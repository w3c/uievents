Abstract:
	*** Wheel Events ***
	
	Note: This is an experimental split of the UI Events spec into smaller, event-specific
	specs. The split was made from an out-of-date snapshot, so the information here is not
	current, so please focus on the overall structure rather than the specifics of the
	content. If this experiment goes well, then we will split the current spec after all
	outstanding pull requests have been handled.

<h2 id="events-wheelevents">Wheel Events</h2>

	Wheels are devices that can be rotated in one or more spatial dimensions, and which can be associated with a pointer device. The coordinate system depends on the
	environment configuration.

	<p class="example">
	The user's environment might be configured to associate vertical scrolling
	with rotation along the y-axis, horizontal scrolling with rotation along the
	x-axis, and zooming with rotation along the z-axis.
	</p>

	The deltaX, deltaY, and deltaZ attributes of {{WheelEvent}} objects indicate
	a measurement along their respective axes in units of pixels, lines, or
	pages. The reported measurements are provided after an environment-specific
	algorithm translates the actual rotation/movement of the wheel device into
	the appropriate values and units.

	<p class="note">
	A user's environment settings can be customized to interpret actual rotation/movement
	of a wheel device in different ways.
	One movement of a common <q>dented</q> mouse wheel can produce a measurement of 162 pixels
	(162 is just an example value, actual values can depend on the current screen
	dimensions of the user-agent).
	But a user can change their default environment settings to speed-up their mouse wheel,
	increasing this number.
	Furthermore, some mouse wheel software can support acceleration (the faster the wheel
	is rotated/moved, the greater the <a>delta</a> of each measurement) or even sub-pixel <a>rotation</a>
	measurements.
	Because of this, authors can not assume a given <a>rotation</a> amount in one user agent will
	produce the same <a>delta</a> value in all user agents.
	</p>

	The sign (positive or negative) of the values of the deltaX, deltaY, and deltaZ attributes
	MUST be consistent between multiple dispatches of the
	EVENT{wheel} event while the
	motion of the actual wheel device is rotating/moving in the same direction.
	If a user agent scrolls as the default action of the
	EVENT{wheel} event then the sign
	of the <a>delta</a> SHOULD be given by a right-hand coordinate system where positive X,
	Y, and Z axes are directed towards the right-most edge, bottom-most edge, and farthest
	depth (away from the user) of the document, respectively.

	<p class="note">
	Individual user agents can (depending on their environment and hardware configuration)
	interpret the same physical user interaction on the wheel differently.
	For example, a vertical swipe on the edge of a trackpad from top to bottom can be
	interpreted as a wheel action intended to either scroll the
	page down or to pan the page up (i.e., resulting in either a positive or negative
	deltaY value respectively).
	</p>

	A <a>user agent</a> MUST create a <a>wheel event transaction</a> when the first wheel event
	is fired, so that all subsequent wheel events within a implementation-specific amount of
	time can be targetted at the same element. A <dfn>wheel event transaction</dfn> is series of
	wheel events that are associated with a single user gesture. The
	<a>wheel event transaction</a> MUST have an associated event target that is the
	<a>topmost event target</a> at the time the first wheel event occurs in the group.

	<p class="example">
	If a series of wheel events targetted in a scrollable element start above a child element,
	later events for the same user gesture may occur over the child element.
	</p>

	<h3 id="interface-wheelevent">Interface WheelEvent</h3>

		<p class="intro-dom">Introduced in this specification</p>

		The {{WheelEvent}} interface provides specific contextual information
		associated with EVENT{wheel} events.

		To create an instance of the {{WheelEvent}} interface, use the {{WheelEvent}} constructor,
		passing an optional {{WheelEventInit}} dictionary.

			A <a>user agent</a> MUST dispatch this event when a mouse wheel has
			been rotated around any axis, or when an equivalent input device
			(such as a mouse-ball, certain tablets or touchpads, etc.) has
			emulated such an action. Depending on the platform and input device,
			diagonal wheel <a>deltas</a> MAY be delivered either as a single
			EVENT{wheel} event with multiple non-zero axes or as separate
			EVENT{wheel} events for each non-zero axis.

			The typical <a>default action</a> of the EVENT{wheel} event type is
			to scroll (or in some cases, zoom) the document by the indicated
			amount.  If this event is canceled, the implementation MUST NOT
			scroll or zoom the document (or perform whatever other
			implementation-specific default action is associated with this event
			type).

			<p class="note">
			In some <a>user agents</a>, or with some input devices, the speed
			that the wheel has been turned can affect the <a>delta</a> values,
			with a faster speed producing a higher <a>delta</a> value.
			</p>

		<h4 id="cancelability-of-wheel-events">cancelability of wheel events</h4>
			<p>
			Calling <code>preventDefault</code> on a wheel event can prevent
			or otherwise interrupt scrolling. For maximum scroll performance, a
			user agent may not wait for each wheel event associated with the scroll
			to be processed to see if it will be canceled. In such cases the user
			agent should generate <code>wheel</code> events whose
			<code>cancelable</code> property is <code>false</code>, indicating that
			<code>preventDefault</code> cannot be used to prevent or interrupt
			scrolling. Otherwise <code>cancelable</code> will be <code>true</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
			In particular, a user agent should generate only uncancelable
			<code>wheel</code> events when it
			<a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#observing-event-listeners">observes
			that there are no non-passive listeners</a> for the event.

	an input device, causes an element to fulfill a defined task.  The task MAY
	be defined for that element by the <a>host language</a>, or by
	author-defined variables, or both.  The default task for any given element
	MAY be a generic action, or MAY be unique to that element.  For example, the
	activation behavior of an HTML or SVG <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element is to
	cause the <a>user agent</a> to traverse the link specified in the
	<code>href</code> attribute, with the further optional parameter of
	specifying the browsing context for the traversal (such as the current
	window or tab, a named window, or a new window). The activation behavior of
	an HTML <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with the <code>type</code>
	attribute value <code>submit</code> is be to send the values of the form
	elements to an author-defined IRI by the author-defined HTTP method.  See
	[[#event-flow-activation]] for more details.

: <dfn>activation trigger</dfn>
::	An event which is defined to initiate an <a>activation behavior</a>.  Refer
	to [[#event-flow-activation]] for more details.

: <dfn>default action</dfn>
::	A <a>default action</a> is an OPTIONAL supplementary behavior that an
	implementation MUST perform in combination with the dispatch of the event
	object.  Each event type definition, and each specification, defines the
	<a>default action</a> for that event type, if it has one.  An instance of an
	event MAY have more than one <a>default action</a> under some circumstances,
	such as when associated with an <a>activation trigger</a>.  A <a>default
	action</a> MAY be cancelled through the invocation of the
	{{Event/preventDefault()}} method. For more details, see
	[[#event-flow-default-cancel]].

: <dfn>delta</dfn>
::	The estimated scroll amount (in pixels, lines, or pages) that the user agent
	will scroll or zoom the page in response to the physical movement of an
	input device that supports the {{WheelEvent}} interface (such as a mouse
	wheel or touch pad). The value of a <a>delta</a> (e.g., the
	{{WheelEvent/deltaX}}, {{WheelEvent/deltaY}}, or {{WheelEvent/deltaZ}}
	attributes) is to be interpreted in the context of the current
	{{WheelEvent/deltaMode}} property. The relationship between the physical
	movement of a wheel (or other device) and whether the <a>delta</a> is
	positive or negative is environment and device dependent. However, if a user
	agent scrolls as the <a>default action</a> then the sign of the <a>delta</a>
	is given by a right-hand coordinate system where positive X,Y, and Z axes
	are directed towards the right-most edge, bottom-most edge, and farthest
	depth (away from the user) of the <a>document</a>, respectively.

: <dfn>event</dfn>
::	An event is the representation of some occurrence (such as a mouse click on
	the presentation of an element, the removal of child node from an element,
	or any number of other possibilities) which is associated with its <a>event
	target</a>. Each event is an instantiation of one specific <a>event
	type</a>.

: <dfn>event target</dfn>
::	The object to which an <a>event</a> is targeted using the [[#event-flow]].
	The event target is the value of the {{Event/target}} attribute.

: <dfn>host language</dfn>
::	Any language which integrates the features of another language or API
	specification, while normatively referencing the origin specification rather
	than redefining those features, and extending those features only in ways
	defined by the origin specification.  An origin specification typically is
	only intended to be implemented in the context of one or more host
	languages, not as a standalone language.  For example, XHTML, HTML, and SVG
	are host languages for UI Events, and they integrate and extend the objects
	and models defined in this specification.

: <dfn>rotation</dfn>
:: An indication of incremental change on an input device using the
	{{WheelEvent}} interface. On some devices this MAY be a literal rotation of
	a wheel, while on others, it MAY be movement along a flat surface, or
	pressure on a particular button.

: <dfn>topmost event target</dfn>
::	The <a>topmost event target</a> MUST be the element highest in the rendering
	order which is capable of being an <a>event target</a>. In graphical user
	interfaces this is the element under the user's pointing device. A user
	interface's <q>hit testing</q> facility is used to determine the target. For
	specific details regarding hit testing and stacking order, refer to the
	<a>host language</a>.

: <dfn>un-initialized value</dfn>
::	The value of any event attribute (such as {{Event/bubbles}} or
	{{Event/currentTarget}}) before the event has been initialized with
	{{Event/initEvent()}}. The un-initialized values of an event apply
	immediately after a new event has been created using the method
	{{Document/createEvent()}}.

: <dfn>user agent</dfn>
::	A program, such as a browser or content authoring tool, normally running on
	a client machine, which acts on a user's behalf in retrieving, interpreting,
	executing, presenting, or creating content.  Users MAY act on the content
	using different user agents at different times, for different purposes.  See
	the [[#conf-interactive-ua]] and [[#conf-author-tools]] for details on the
	requirements for a <em>conforming</em> user agent.

: <dfn>Window</dfn>
::	The <code>Window</code> is the object referred to by the current <a>document</a>'s
	browsing context's Window Proxy object as defined in
	<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#windowproxy" title="HTML5 WindowProxy description">HTML5</a>
	[[HTML5]].
