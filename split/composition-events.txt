Abstract:
	*** Composition Events ***
	
	Note: This is an experimental split of the UI Events spec into smaller, event-specific
	specs. The split was made from an out-of-date snapshot, so the information here is not
	current, so please focus on the overall structure rather than the specifics of the
	content. If this experiment goes well, then we will split the current spec after all
	outstanding pull requests have been handled.

This specification follows the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Schepers/spec-conventions.html">Proposed W3C Specification Conventions</a>,
with the following supplemental additions:

*   The <a href="#key-legends"><em>key cap</em></a> printed on a key is shown as
	KEYCAP{&darr;}, KEYCAP{=} or KEYCAP{Q}. This is used to refer to a
	key from the user's perspective without regard for the
	{{KeyboardEvent/key}} and {{KeyboardEvent/code}} values in the
	generated {{KeyboardEvent}}.

*   Glyphs representing character are shown as: GLYPH{&#x239C2;}.

*   Unicode character encodings are shown as: UNI{U+003d}.

*   Names of key values generated by a key press (i.e., the value of
	{{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/key}}) are shown as:
	KEY{ArrowDown}, KEY_NOLINK{=}, KEY_NOLINK{q} or KEY_NOLINK{Q}.

*   Names of key codes associated with the physical keys (i.e., the
	value of {{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/code}}) are shown as:
	CODE{ArrowDown}, CODE{Equal} or CODE{KeyQ}.


In addition, certain terms are used in this specification with particular
meanings.  The term <q>implementation</q> applies to a browser, content
authoring tool, or other <a>user agent</a> that implements this specification,
while a content author is a person who writes script or code that takes
advantage of the interfaces, methods, attributes, events, and other features
described in this specification in order to make Web applications, and a user is
the person who uses those Web applications in an implementation.

<h2 id="events-compositionevents">Composition Events</h2>

	Composition Events provide a means for inputing text in a supplementary or
	alternate manner than by Keyboard Events, in order to allow the use of
	characters that might not be commonly available on keyboard. For example,
	Composition Events might be used to add accents to characters despite their
	absence from standard US keyboards, to build up logograms of many Asian
	languages from their base components or categories, to select word choices
	from a combination of key presses on a mobile device keyboard, or to convert
	voice commands into text using a speech recognition processor. Refer to
	[[#keys]] for examples on how Composition Events are used in combination
	with keyboard events.

	Conceptually, a composition session consists of one EVENT{compositionstart}
	event, one or more EVENT{compositionupdate} events, and one
	EVENT{compositionend} event, with the value of the {{CompositionEvent/data}}
	attribute persisting between each <q>stage</q> of this event chain during
	each session.

	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
	While a composition session is active, keyboard events can be dispatched to
	the DOM if the keyboard is the input device used with the composition
	session. See the EVENT{compositionstart} event details</a> and
	<a href="#keys-IME">IME section</a> for relevent event ordering.
	</p>

	Not all <a>IME</a> systems or devices expose the necessary data to the DOM,
	so the active composition string (the <q>Reading Window</q> or <q>candidate
	selection menu option</q>) might not be available through this interface, in
	which case the selection MAY be represented by the <a>empty string</a>.

	<h3 id="interface-compositionevent">Interface CompositionEvent</h3>

		<p class="intro-dom">Introduced in this specification</p>

		The {{CompositionEvent}} interface provides specific contextual
		information associated with Composition Events.

		To create an instance of the {{CompositionEvent}} interface,
		use the {{CompositionEvent}} constructor, passing an optional
		{{CompositionEventInit}} dictionary.

			A <a>user agent</a> MUST dispatch this event when a <a>text
			composition system</a> is enabled and a new composition session is
			about to begin (or has begun, depending on the <a>text composition
			system</a>) in preparation for composing a passage of text. This
			event type is device-dependent, and MAY rely upon the capabilities
			of the text conversion system and how it is mapped into the
			operating system. When a keyboard is used to feed an input method
			editor, this event type is generated after a EVENT{keydown} event,
			but speech or handwriting recognition systems MAY send this event
			type without keyboard events.  Some implementations MAY populate the
			{{CompositionEvent/data}} attribute of the EVENT{compositionstart}
			event with the text currently selected in the document (for editing
			and replacement). Otherwise, the value of the
			{{CompositionEvent/data}} attribute MUST be  the <a>empty string</a>.

			This event MUST be dispatched immediately before a <a>text
			composition system</a> begins a new composition session, and before
			the DOM is modified due to the composition process. The default
			action of this event is for the <a>text composition system</a> to
			start a new composition session. If this event is canceled, the
			<a>text composition system</a> SHOULD discard the current
			composition session.

			<p class="note">
			Canceling the EVENT{compositionstart} <em>event type</em> is
			distinct from canceling the <a>text composition system</a> itself
			(e.g., by hitting a cancel button or closing an <a>IME</a> window).
			</p>

			<p class="note">
			Some IMEs do not support cancelling an in-progress composition
			session (e.g., such as GTK which doesn't presently have such an
			API). In these cases, calling {{Event/preventDefault()}} will not
			stop this event's default action.

			A <a>user agent</a> MUST dispatch this event when a <a>text

			This event is dispatched immediately after the <a>text composition
			system</a> completes the composition session (e.g., the <a>IME</a>
			is closed, minimized, switched out of focus, or otherwise dismissed,
			and the focus switched back to the <a>user agent</a>).

<h2 id="legacy-event-initializers">Legacy Event Initializers</h2>

	<em>This section is normative.</em>
	
	The following features are obsolete and should only be implemented by
	<a>user agents</a> that require compatibility with legacy software.</em>

	Early versions of this specification included an initialization method on
	the interface (for example <code>initMouseEvent</code>) that required a long
	list of parameters that, in most cases, did not fully initialize all
	attributes of the event object. Because of this, event interfaces which were
	derived from the basic {{Event}} interface required that the initializer of
	<em>each</em> of the derived interfaces be called explicitly in order to
	fully initialize an event.

	<div class="example">
	Initializing all the attributes of a MutationEvent requires calls to two
	initializer methods: <code>initEvent</code> and
	<code>initMutationEvent</code>.
	</div>

	Due in part to the length of time in the development of this standard, some
	implementations MAY have taken a dependency on these (now deprecated)
	initializer methods. For completeness, these legacy event initializers are
	described in this section.

	<h3 id="idl-interface-CompositionEvent-initializers">Initializers for interface CompositionEvent</h3>

		<em>This section is informative</em>

		<p class="note">
		The argument list to this legacy CompositionEvent initializer does not
		include the <code>detailArg</code> (present in other initializers) and
		adds the <code>locale</code> argument (see [[#changes-drafts]]); it is
		necessary to preserve this inconsistency for compatibility with existing
		implementations.

This section will be deleted.

Temporary glossary terms (for bikeshed linker).
Many of these are properly defined elsewhere and should be linked to directly. 
Terms which should be defined in this spec should be defined inline.

: <dfn>activation behavior</dfn>
::	The action taken when an <a>event</a>, typically initiated by users through
	an input device, causes an element to fulfill a defined task.  The task MAY
	be defined for that element by the <a>host language</a>, or by
	author-defined variables, or both.  The default task for any given element
	MAY be a generic action, or MAY be unique to that element.  For example, the
	activation behavior of an HTML or SVG <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element is to
	cause the <a>user agent</a> to traverse the link specified in the
	<code>href</code> attribute, with the further optional parameter of
	specifying the browsing context for the traversal (such as the current
	window or tab, a named window, or a new window). The activation behavior of
	an HTML <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with the <code>type</code>
	attribute value <code>submit</code> is be to send the values of the form
	elements to an author-defined IRI by the author-defined HTTP method.  See
	[[#event-flow-activation]] for more details.

: <dfn>activation trigger</dfn>
::	An event which is defined to initiate an <a>activation behavior</a>.  Refer
	to [[#event-flow-activation]] for more details.

: <dfn>default action</dfn>
::	A <a>default action</a> is an OPTIONAL supplementary behavior that an
	implementation MUST perform in combination with the dispatch of the event
	object.  Each event type definition, and each specification, defines the
	<a>default action</a> for that event type, if it has one.  An instance of an
	event MAY have more than one <a>default action</a> under some circumstances,
	such as when associated with an <a>activation trigger</a>.  A <a>default
	action</a> MAY be cancelled through the invocation of the
	{{Event/preventDefault()}} method. For more details, see
	[[#event-flow-default-cancel]].

: <dfn>empty string</dfn>
::	The empty string is a value of type <code>DOMString</code> of length
	<code>0</code>, i.e., a string which contains no characters (neither
	printing nor control characters).

: <dfn>event</dfn>
::	An event is the representation of some occurrence (such as a mouse click on
	the presentation of an element, the removal of child node from an element,
	or any number of other possibilities) which is associated with its <a>event
	target</a>. Each event is an instantiation of one specific <a>event
	type</a>.

: <dfn>event target</dfn>
::	The object to which an <a>event</a> is targeted using the [[#event-flow]].
	The event target is the value of the {{Event/target}} attribute.

: <dfn>host language</dfn>
::	Any language which integrates the features of another language or API
	specification, while normatively referencing the origin specification rather
	than redefining those features, and extending those features only in ways
	defined by the origin specification.  An origin specification typically is
	only intended to be implemented in the context of one or more host
	languages, not as a standalone language.  For example, XHTML, HTML, and SVG
	are host languages for UI Events, and they integrate and extend the objects
	and models defined in this specification.

: <dfn>IME</dfn>
: <dfn>input method editor</dfn>
:: 	An <em>input method editor</em> (IME), also known as a <em>front end
	processor</em>, is an application that performs the conversion between
	keystrokes and ideographs or other characters, usually by user-guided
	dictionary lookup, often used in East Asian languages (e.g., Chinese,
	Japanese, Korean).  An <a>IME</a> MAY also be used for dictionary-based word
	completion, such as on mobile devices.  See [[#keys-IME]] for treatment of
	IMEs in this specification.  See also <a>text composition system</a>.

: <dfn>text composition system</dfn>
::	A software component that interprets some form of alternate input (such as a
	<a>input method editor</a>, a speech processor, or a handwriting recognition
	system) and converts it to text.

: <dfn>un-initialized value</dfn>
::	The value of any event attribute (such as {{Event/bubbles}} or
	{{Event/currentTarget}}) before the event has been initialized with
	{{Event/initEvent()}}. The un-initialized values of an event apply
	immediately after a new event has been created using the method
	{{Document/createEvent()}}.

: <dfn>user agent</dfn>
::	A program, such as a browser or content authoring tool, normally running on
	a client machine, which acts on a user's behalf in retrieving, interpreting,
	executing, presenting, or creating content.  Users MAY act on the content
	using different user agents at different times, for different purposes.  See
	the [[#conf-interactive-ua]] and [[#conf-author-tools]] for details on the
	requirements for a <em>conforming</em> user agent.

: <dfn>Window</dfn>
::	The <code>Window</code> is the object referred to by the current <a>document</a>'s
	browsing context's Window Proxy object as defined in
	<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#windowproxy" title="HTML5 WindowProxy description">HTML5</a>
	[[HTML5]].
