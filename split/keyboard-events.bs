Abstract:
	*** Keyboard Events ***

	Note: This is an experimental split of the UI Events spec into smaller, event-specific
	specs. The split was made from an out-of-date snapshot, so the information here is not
	current, so please focus on the overall structure rather than the specifics of the
	content. If this experiment goes well, then we will split the current spec after all
	outstanding pull requests have been handled.

<h2 id="style-conventions">Stylistic Conventions</h2>

This specification follows the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Schepers/spec-conventions.html">Proposed W3C Specification Conventions</a>,
with the following supplemental additions:

*   The <a href="#key-legends"><em>key cap</em></a> printed on a key is shown as
	<code class="keycap">&darr;</code>, <code class="keycap">=</code> or <code class="keycap">Q</code>. This is used to refer to a
	key from the user's perspective without regard for the
	{{KeyboardEvent/key}} and {{KeyboardEvent/code}} values in the
	generated {{KeyboardEvent}}.

*   Glyphs representing character are shown as: <code class="glyph">"&#x239C2;"</code>.

*   Unicode character encodings are shown as: <code class="unicode">U+003d</code>.

*   Names of key values generated by a key press (i.e., the value of
	{{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/key}}) are shown as:
	<code class="key">"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/#key-ArrowDown">ArrowDown</a>"</code>, <code class="key">"="</code>, <code class="key">"q"</code> or <code class="key">"Q"</code>.

*   Names of key codes associated with the physical keys (i.e., the
	value of {{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/code}}) are shown as:
	<code class="code">"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/#code-ArrowDown">ArrowDown</a>"</code>, <code class="code">"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/#code-Equal">Equal</a>"</code> or <code class="code">"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/#code-KeyQ">KeyQ</a>"</code>.


In addition, certain terms are used in this specification with particular
meanings.  The term <q>implementation</q> applies to a browser, content
authoring tool, or other <a>user agent</a> that implements this specification,
while a content author is a person who writes script or code that takes
advantage of the interfaces, methods, attributes, events, and other features
described in this specification in order to make Web applications, and a user is
the person who uses those Web applications in an implementation.

<h2 id="events-keyboardevents">Keyboard Events</h2>

	Keyboard events are device dependent, i.e., they rely on the capabilities of
	the input devices and how they are mapped in the operating systems. Refer to
	<a href="#keys">Keyboard events and key values</a> for more details,
	including examples on how Keyboard Events are used in combination with
	Composition Events. Depending on the character generation device, keyboard
	events might not be generated.

	<p class="note">
	Keyboard events are only one modality of providing textual input. For
	editing scenarios, consider also using the {{InputEvent}} as an alternate to
	(or in addition to) keyboard events.
	</p>

	<h3 id="interface-keyboardevent">Interface KeyboardEvent</h3>

		<p class="intro-dom">Introduced in this specification</p>

		The {{KeyboardEvent}} interface provides specific contextual information
		associated with keyboard devices. Each keyboard event references a key
		using a value. Keyboard events are commonly directed at the element that
		has the focus.

		The {{KeyboardEvent}} interface provides convenient attributes for some
		common modifiers keys: {{KeyboardEvent/ctrlKey}},
		{{KeyboardEvent/shiftKey}}, {{KeyboardEvent/altKey}},
		{{KeyboardEvent/metaKey}}. These attributes are equivalent to using the
		method {{KeyboardEvent/getModifierState()}} with <code class="keycap">Control</code>,
		<code class="keycap">Shift</code>, <code class="keycap">Alt</code>, or <code class="keycap">Meta</code> respectively.

		To create an instance of the {{KeyboardEvent}} interface, use the
		{{KeyboardEvent}} constructor, passing an optional
		{{KeyboardEventInit}} dictionary.

	<div class="warning">
	Legacy keyboard event implementations include three additional attributes,
	<code>keyCode</code>, <code>charCode</code>, and <code>which</code>. The
	<code>keyCode</code> attribute indicates a numeric value associated with a
	particular key on a computer keyboard, while the <code>charCode</code>
	attribute indicates the <abbr title="American Standard Code for
	Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> value of the character associated
	with that key (which might be the same as the <code>keyCode</code> value)
	and is applicable only to keys that produce a <a>character value</a>.

	In practice, <code>keyCode</code> and <code>charCode</code> are inconsistent
	across platforms and even the same implementation on different operating
	systems or using different localizations. This specification does not define
	values for either <code>keyCode</code> or <code>charCode</code>, or behavior
	for <code>charCode</code>. In conforming UI Events implementations, content
	authors can instead use {{KeyboardEvent/key}} and {{KeyboardEvent/code}}.

	<em>For more information, see the informative appendix on
	<a href="#legacy-key-attributes">Legacy key attributes</a>.</em>
	</div>

	<p class="note">
	For compatibility with existing content, virtual keyboards, such as software
	keyboards on screen-based input devices, are expected to produce the normal
	range of keyboard events, even though they do not possess physical keys.
	</p>

	<p class="note">
	In some implementations or system configurations, some key events, or their
	values, might be suppressed by the <a>IME</a> in use.

	<h3 id="events-keyboard-key-location">Keyboard Event Key Location</h3>

		The {{KeyboardEvent/location}} attribute can be used to disambiguate
		between {{KeyboardEvent/key}} values that can be generated by different
		physical keys on the keyboard, for example, the left and right
		<code class="keycap">Shift</code> key or the physical arrow keys vs. the numpad arrow keys
		(when <code class="keycap">NumLock</code> is off).

		The following table defines the valid {{KeyboardEvent/location}} values
		for the special keys that have more than one location on the keyboard:

<table class="event-sequence-table">

		{{KeyboardEvent/DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD}}.

	<h3 id="events-keyboard-event-order">Keyboard Event Order</h3>

		The keyboard events defined in this specification occur in a set order
		relative to one another, for any given key:

<table class="event-sequence-table">
<thead><tr><td class="cell-number"></th><th>Event Type</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td class="cell-number">1</td><td><a><code>keydown</code></a></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td class="cell-number">2</td><td><a><code>beforeinput</code></a></td><td><em>(only for keys which produce a <a>character value</a>)</em></td></tr>
<tr><td class="cell-number"></td><td></td><td><em>Any <a>default actions</a> related to this key, such as inserting a character in to the DOM.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td class="cell-number">3</td><td><a><code>input</code></a></td><td><em>(only for keys which have updated the DOM)</em></td></tr>
<tr><td class="cell-number"></td><td></td><td><em>Any events as a result of the key being held for a sustained period (see below).</em></td></tr>
<tr><td class="cell-number">4</td><td><a><code>keyup</code></a></td><td></td></tr>
</table>

		If the key is depressed for a sustained period, the following events MAY
		repeat at an environment-dependent rate: <!-- and the key should seek
		counseling -->

<table class="event-sequence-table">
<thead><tr><td class="cell-number"></th><th>Event Type</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td class="cell-number">1</td><td><a><code>keydown</code></a></td><td><em>(with {{KeyboardEvent/repeat}} attribute set to <code>true</code>)</em></td></tr>
<tr><td class="cell-number">2</td><td><a><code>beforeinput</code></a></td><td><em>(only for keys which produce a <a>character value</a>)</em></td></tr>
<tr><td class="cell-number"></td><td></td><td><em>Any <a>default actions</a> related to this key, such as inserting a character in to the DOM.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td class="cell-number">3</td><td><a><code>input</code></a></td><td><em>(only for keys which have updated the DOM)</em></td></tr>
</table>

		<p class="note">
		Typically, any <a>default actions</a> associated with any particular key
		are completed before the <a><code>keyup</code></a> event is dispatched. This might
		delay the <a><code>keyup</code></a> event slightly (though this is not likely to be a
		perceptible delay).
		</p>

		The <a>event target</a> of a key event is the currently focused element
		which is processing the keyboard activity. This is often an HTML
		<code>input</code> element or a textual element which is editable, but
		MAY be an element defined by the <a>host language</a> to accept keyboard
		input for non-text purposes, such as the activation of an accelerator
		key or trigger of some other behavior. If no suitable element is in
		focus, the event target will be the HTML <a>body element</a> if
		available, otherwise the <a>root element</a>.

		<p class="note">
		The <a>event target</a> might change between different key events. For
		example, a <a><code>keydown</code></a> event for the <code class="keycap">Tab</code> key will likely have
		a different <a>event target</a> than the  <a><code>keyup</code></a> event on the same
		keystroke.

	This section contains necessary information regarding keyboard events:

	*	Explanation of keyboard layout, mapping, and key values.
	*	Relations between keys, such as <a>dead keys</a> or modifiers keys.
	*	Relations between keyboard events and their default actions.
	*	The set of <code>key</code> values, and guidelines on how to extend this set.

	</p>

	<h3 id="keyboard-input">Keyboard Input</h3>

		<em>This section is non-normative</em>

		The relationship of each key to the complete keyboard has three separate
		aspects, each of which vary among different models and configurations of
		keyboards, particularly for locale-specific reasons:

		*	<strong>Mechanical layout:</strong> the dimensions, size, and placement
			of the physical keys on the keyboard
		*	<strong>Visual markings:</strong> the labels (or <em>legends</em>) that
			mark each key
		*	<strong>Functional mapping:</strong> the abstract key-value association
			of each key.

		This specification only defines the functional mapping, in terms of
		<a href="#keys-keyvalues"><code>key</code></a> values and
		<a href="#keys-codevalues"><code>code</code></a> values,
		but briefly describes <a href="#key-legends">key legends</a>
		for background.

		<h4 id="key-legends">Key Legends</h4>

			<em>This section is informative</em>

			The key legend is the visual marking that is printed or embossed on the
			<em>key cap</em> (the rectangular "cap" that covers the mechanical
			switch for the key). These markings normally consist of one or more
			characters that a keystroke on that key will produce (such as <code class="glyph">"G"</code>,
			<code class="glyph">"8"</code>, or <code class="glyph">"ш"</code>), or names or symbols which indicate that key's
			function (such as an upward-pointing arrow <code class="glyph">"&#x21E7;"</code> indicating
			<code class="keycap">Shift</code>, or the string <code>"Enter"</code>). Keys are often
			referred to by this marking (e.g., <q>Press the <code>"Shift"</code> and
			<code>"G"</code> keys.</q>). Note, however, that the visual appearance
			of the key has no bearing on its digital representation, and in many
			configurations may be completely inaccurate. Even the control and
			function keys, such as <code class="keycap">Enter</code>, may be mapped to different
			functionality, or even mapped as character keys.

			<p class="note">
			Many keyboards contain keys that do not normally produce any characters,
			even though the symbol might have a Unicode equivalent. For example, the
			<code class="keycap">Shift</code> key might bear the symbol <code class="glyph">"&#x21E7;"</code>, which has the
			Unicode code point <code class="unicode">U+21E7</code>, but
			pressing the <code class="keycap">Shift</code> key will not produce this character value,
			and there is no Unicode code point for <code class="keycap">Shift</code>.
			</p>

	<h3 id="keys-codevalues">Key codes</h3>

		A key {{KeyboardEvent/code}} is an attribute of a keyboard event that can be
		used to identify the physical key associated with the keyboard event. It is
		similar to USB Usage IDs in that it provides a low-level value (similar to a
		scancode) that is vendor-neutral.

		The primary purpose of the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute is to provide a
		consistent and coherent way to identify keys based on their physical
		location. In addition, it also provides a stable name (unaffected by the
		current keyboard state) that uniquely identifies each key on the keyboard.

		The list of valid {{KeyboardEvent/code}} values is defined in the
		[[!UIEvents-Code]].

		<h4 id="code-motivation">Motivation for the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} Attribute</h4>

			The standard PC keyboard has a set of keys (which we refer to as
			<em>writing system keys</em>) that generate different
			{{KeyboardEvent/key}} values based on the current keyboard layout
			selected by the user. This situation makes it difficult to write code
			that detects keys based on their physical location since the code would
			need to know which layout is in effect in order to know which
			{{KeyboardEvent/key}} values to check for. A real-world example of this
			is a game that wants to use the <code class="glyph">"W"</code>, <code class="glyph">"A"</code>, <code class="glyph">"S"</code> and
			<code class="glyph">"D"</code> keys to control player movement. The {{KeyboardEvent/code}}
			attribute solves this problem by providing a stable value to check that
			is <em>not affected by the current keyboard layout</em>.

			In addition, the values in the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute depend as
			well on the current keyboard state. Because of this, the order in which
			keys are pressed and released in relation to modifier keys can affect
			the values stored in the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute. The
			{{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute solves this problem by providing a
			stable value that is <em>not affected by the current keyboard state</em>.

		<h4 id="relationship-between-key-code">The Relationship Between {{KeyboardEvent/key}} and {{KeyboardEvent/code}}</h4>

			<dl>
				<dt>{{KeyboardEvent/key}}</dt>
				<dd>The {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute is intended for users who
					are interested in the meaning of the key being pressed, taking
					into account the current keyboard layout (and IME;
					<a href="#keys-dead">dead keys</a> are given a unique
					{{KeyboardEvent/key}} value). Example use case: Detecting
					modified keys or bare modifier keys (e.g., to perform an action
					in response to a keyboard shortcut).
				</dd>

				<dt>{{KeyboardEvent/code}}</dt>
				<dd>The {{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute is intended for users who
					are interested in the key that was pressed by the user, without
					any layout modifications applied. Example use case: Detecting
					WASD keys (e.g., for movement controls in a game) or trapping
					all keys (e.g., in a remote desktop client to send all keys to
					the remote host).

		<h4 id="code-virtual-keyboards">{{KeyboardEvent/code}} and Virtual Keyboards</h4>

			The usefulness of the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute is less obvious
			for virtual keyboards (and also for remote controls and chording
			keyboards). In general, if a virtual (or remote control) keyboard is
			mimicking the layout and functionality of a standard keyboard, then it
			MUST also set the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute as appropriate. For
			keyboards which are not mimicking the layout of a standard keyboard,
			then the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute MAY be set to the closest
			match on a standard keyboard or it MAY be left undefined.

			For virtual keyboards with keys that produce different values based on
			some modifier state, the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} value should be the
			{{KeyboardEvent/key}} value generated when the button is pressed while
			the device is in its factory-reset state.

	<h3 id="keys-keyvalues">Keyboard Event <code>key</code> Values</h3>

		A key value is a <code>DOMString</code> that can be used to indicate any
		given key on a keyboard, regardless of position or state, by the value it
		produces.  These key values MAY be used as return values for keyboard events
		generated by the implementation, or as input values by the content author to
		specify desired input (such as for keyboard shortcuts).

		The list of valid <code>key</code> values is defined in [[!UIEvents-Key]].

		Key values can be used to detect the value of a key which has been pressed,
		using the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute.  Content authors can retrieve the
		<a>character value</a> of upper- or lower-case letters, number, symbols, or
		other character-producing keys, and also the <a>key value</a> of control
		keys, modifier keys, function keys, or other keys that do not generate
		characters. These values can be used for monitoring particular input
		strings, for detecting and acting on modifier key input in combination with
		other inputs (such as a mouse), for creating virtual keyboards, or for any
		number of other purposes.

		Key values can also be used by content authors in string comparisons, as
		values for markup attributes (such as the HTML <code>accesskey</code>) in
		conforming <a>host languages</a>, or for other related purposes.   A
		conforming <a>host language</a> SHOULD allow content authors to use either
		of the two equivalent string values for a key value: the <a>character
		value</a>, or the <a>key value</a>.

		<p class="note">
		While implementations will use the most relevant value for a key
		independently of the platform or keyboard layout mappings, content authors
		can not make assumptions on the ability of keyboard devices to generate
		them.  When using keyboard events and key values for shortcut-key
		combinations, content authors can <q>consider using numbers and function
		keys (<code class="keycap">F4</code>, <code class="keycap">F5</code>, and so on) instead of letters</q> ([[DWW95]])
		given that most keyboard layouts will provide keys for those.
		</p>

		A key value does not indicate a specific key on the physical keyboard, nor
		does it reflect the character printed on the key. A key value indicates the
		current value of the event with consideration to the current state of all
		active keys and key input modes (including shift modes), as reflected in the
		operating-system mapping of the keyboard and reported to the implementation.
		In other words, the key value for the key labeled <code class="keycap">O</code> on a
		<a>QWERTY</a> keyboard has the key value <code class="key">"o"</code> in an unshifted state and
		<code class="key">"O"</code> in a shifted state. Because a user can map their keyboard to an
		arbitrary custom configuration, the content author is encouraged not to
		assume that a relationship exists between the shifted and unshifted states
		of a key and the majuscule form (uppercase or capital letters) and minuscule
		form (lowercase or small letters) of a character representation, but is
		encouraged instead to use the value of the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute.
		For example, the Standard "102" Keyboard layout depicted in [[UIEvents-Code]]
		illustrates one possible set of <a>key mappings</a> on one possible keyboard
		layout. Many others exist, both standard and idiosyncratic.

		<p class="note">
		To simplify <a>dead key</a> support, when the operating-system mapping of
		the keyboard is handling a <a>dead key</a> state, the current state of the
		dead key sequence is not reported via the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute.
		Rather, a key value of <code class="key">"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/#key-Dead">Dead</a>"</code> is reported. Instead, implementations
		generate <a href="#events-compositionevents">composition events</a> which
		contain the intermediate state of the dead key sequence reported via the
		{{CompositionEvent/data}} attribute. As in the previous example, the key
		value for the key marked <code class="keycap">O</code> on a <a>QWERTY</a> keyboard has a
		{{CompositionEvent/data}} value of <code class="char">"&#xF6;"</code> in an
		unshifted state during a dead-key operation to add an umlaut diacritic, and
		<code class="char">"&#xD6;"</code> in a shifted state during a dead-key
		operation to add an umlaut diacritic.
		</p>

		It is also important to note that there is not a one-to-one relationship
		between key event states and key values.  A particular key value might be
		associated with multiple keys. For example, many standard keyboards contain
		more than one key with the <code class="keycap">Shift</code> key value (normally distinguished
		by the {{KeyboardEvent/location}} values
		{{KeyboardEvent/DOM_KEY_LOCATION_LEFT}} and
		{{KeyboardEvent/DOM_KEY_LOCATION_RIGHT}}) or <code class="keycap">8</code> key value (normally
		distinguished by the {{KeyboardEvent/location}} values
		{{KeyboardEvent/DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD}} and
		{{KeyboardEvent/DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD}}), and user-configured custom
		keyboard layouts MAY duplicate any key value in multiple key-state scenarios
		(note that {{KeyboardEvent/location}} is intended for standard keyboard
		layouts, and cannot always indicate a meaningful distinction).

		Finally, the meaning of any given character representation is
		context-dependent and complex.  For example, in some contexts, the asterisk
		(star) glyph (<code class="glyph">"*"</code>) represents a footnote or
		emphasis (when bracketing a passage of text). However, in some documents or
		executable programs it is equivalent to the mathematical multiplication
		operation, while in other documents or executable programs, that function is
		reserved for the multiplication symbol (<code class="glyph">"&#xD7;"</code>, Unicode value
		<code class="unicode">U+00D7</code>) or the Latin small letter <code>"x"</code>
		(due to the lack of a multiplication key on many keyboards and the
		superficial resemblance of the glyphs <code class="glyph">"&#xD7;"</code> and <code class="glyph">"x"</code>).  Thus,
		the semantic meaning or function of character representations is outside the
		scope of this specification.

		<h4 id="keys-modifiers">Modifier keys</h4>

			Keyboard input uses modifier keys to change the normal behavior of a
			key. Like other keys, modifier keys generate <a><code>keydown</code></a> and
			<a><code>keyup</code></a> events, as shown in the example below. Some modifiers are
			activated while the key is being pressed down or maintained pressed such
			as <code class="keycap">Alt</code>, <code class="keycap">Control</code>, <code class="keycap">Shift</code>, <code class="keycap">AltGraph</code>, or
			<code class="keycap">Meta</code>. Other modifiers are activated depending on their state
			such as <code class="keycap">CapsLock</code>, <code class="keycap">NumLock</code>, or <code class="keycap">ScrollLock</code>. Change
			in the state happens when the modifier key is being pressed down. The
			{{KeyboardEvent}} interface provides convenient attributes for some
			common modifiers keys: {{KeyboardEvent/ctrlKey}},
			{{KeyboardEvent/shiftKey}}, {{KeyboardEvent/altKey}},
			{{KeyboardEvent/metaKey}}. Some operating systems simulate the
			<code class="keycap">AltGraph</code> modifier key with the combination of the <code class="keycap">Alt</code>
			and <code class="keycap">Control</code> modifier keys. Implementations are encouraged to use
			the <code class="keycap">AltGraph</code> modifier key.

			<p class="note">
			The value in the <a><code>keydown</code></a> and <a><code>keyup</code></a> events varies based on

			Arabic layout will generate different events even though they are the

			physical key, you will need to make use of the {{KeyboardEvent/code}}
			attribute.
			</p>

			In some cases, <a>modifier keys</a> change the {{KeyboardEvent/key}}
			value for a key event. For example, on some MacOS keyboards, the  key
			labeled "delete" functions the same as the <code class="keycap">Backspace</code> key on the
			Windows OS when unmodified, but when modified by the <code class="keycap">Fn</code> key,
			acts as the <code class="keycap">Delete</code> key, and the value of {{KeyboardEvent/key}}
			will match the most appropriate function of the key in its current
			modified state.

		<h4 id="keys-dead">Dead keys</h4>

			Some keyboard input uses <a>dead keys</a> for the input of composed
			character sequences. Unlike the handwriting sequence, in which users
			enter the base character first, keyboard input requires to enter a
			special state when a <a>dead key</a> is pressed and emit the
			character(s) only when one of a limited number of <q>legal</q> base
			character is entered.

			<p class="note">
			The MacOS and Linux operating systems use input methods to process
			<a>dead keys</a>.
			</p>

			The <a>dead keys</a> (across all keyboard layouts and mappings) are
			represented by the key value <code class="keycap">Dead</code>. In response to any dead key
			press, <a href="#events-compositionevents"> composition events</a> must
			be dispatched by the user agent and the <a><code>compositionupdate</code></a> event's
			{{CompositionEvent/data}} value must be the character value of the
			current state of the dead key combining sequence.

			While Unicode combining characters always follow the handwriting
			sequence, with the combining character trailing the corresponding
			letter, typical dead key input MAY reverse the sequence, with the
			combining character before the corresponding letter. For example, the
			word <em>naïve</em>, using the combining diacritic <em>¨</em>, would be
			represented sequentially in Unicode as <em>nai¨ve</em>, but MAY be typed
			<em>na¨ive</em>. The sequence of keystrokes <code class="unicode">U+0302</code> (Combining
			Circumflex Accent key) and <code class="unicode">U+0065</code> (key marked with the Latin Small
			Letter E) will likely produce (on a French keyboard using a french
			mapping and without any modifier activated) the Unicode character
			<code class="glyph">"&#xEA;"</code> (Latin Small Letter E With Circumflex), as preferred by
			the Unicode Normalization Form <em>NFC</em>.

		<h4 id="keys-IME">Input Method Editors</h4>

			This specification includes a model for <a>input method editors</a>
			(IMEs), through the {{CompositionEvent}} interface and events.
			However, Composition Events and Keyboard Events do not necessarily map
			as a one-to-one relationship.  As an example, receiving a <a><code>keydown</code></a>
			for the <code class="keycap">Accept</code> key value does not necessarily imply that the
			text currently selected in the <a>IME</a> is being accepted, but
			indicates only that a keystroke happened, disconnected from the
			<a>IME</a> Accept functionality (which would normally result in a
			<a><code>compositionend</code></a> event in most <a>IME</a> systems).  Keyboard
			events cannot be used to determine the current state of the input method
			editor, which can be obtained through the {{CompositionEvent/data}}
			attribute of the {{CompositionEvent}} interface.  Additionally,
			<a>IME</a> systems and devices vary in their functionality, and in which
			keys are used for activating that functionality, such that the
			<code class="keycap">Convert</code> and <code class="keycap">Accept</code> keys MAY be represented by other
			available keys. Keyboard events correspond to the events generated by
			the input device after the keyboard layout mapping.

			<p class="note">
			In some implementations or system configurations, some key events, or
			their values, might be suppressed by the <a>IME</a> in use.
			</p>

			The following example describes a possible sequence of keys to generate
			the Unicode character <code class="glyph">"&#x5E02;"</code> (Kanji character, part of CJK
			Unified Ideographs) using Japanese input methods. This example assumes
			that the input method editor is activated and in the Japanese-Romaji
			input mode. The keys <code class="keycap">Convert</code> and <code class="keycap">Accept</code> MAY be replaced
			by others depending on the input device in use and the configuration of
			the IME, e.g., it can be respectively <code class="unicode">U+0020</code> (Space key) and
			<code class="keycap">Enter</code>.

			<p class="note">
			<code class="glyph">"&#x8A69;"</code> (<q>poem</q>) and <code class="glyph">"&#x5E02;"</code> (<q>city</q>) are
			homophones, both pronounced &#x3057; (<q>shi</q>/<q>si</q>), so the user
			needs to use the <code class="keycap">Convert</code> key to select the proper option.

<h2 id="event-constructors">Constructing Mouse and Keyboard Events</h2>

	Generally, when a constructor of an {{Event}} interface, or of an interface
	inherited from the {{Event}} interface, is invoked, the steps described in
	[[!DOM]] should be followed. However the {{KeyboardEvent}} and
	{{MouseEvent}} interfaces provide additional dictionary members for
	initializing the internal state of the {{Event}} object's key modifiers:
	specifically, the internal state queried for using the
	{{KeyboardEvent/getModifierState()}} and {{MouseEvent/getModifierState()}}
	methods. This section supplements the DOM4 steps for intializing a new
	{{Event}} object with these optional modifier states.

	For the purposes of constructing a {{KeyboardEvent}}, {{MouseEvent}}, or
	object derived from these objects using the algorithm below, all
	{{KeyboardEvent}}, {{MouseEvent}}, and derived objects have
	<dfn id="internal-key-modifier-state">internal key modifier state</dfn> which can be set and
	retrieved using the <a href="#keys-modifiers">key modifier names</a>
	described in the
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/#keys-modifier">Modifier Keys table</a>
	in [[UIEvents-Key]].

	The following steps supplement the algorithm defined for constructing
	events in DOM4:

	*   If the {{Event}} being constructed is a {{KeyboardEvent}} or
		{{MouseEvent}} object or an object that derives from either of these,
		and a {{EventModifierInit}} argument was provided to the constructor,
		then run the following sub-steps:

		*   For each {{EventModifierInit}} argument, if the dictionary member
			begins with the string <code>"modifier"</code>, then let the
			<dfn id="modifier-key-name">key modifier name</dfn> be the
			dictionary member's name excluding the prefix
			<code>"modifier"</code>, and set the {{Event}} object's
			<a href="#internal-key-modifier-state">internal key modifier state</a>
			that matches the <a href="#modifier-key-name">key modifier name</a>
			to the corresponding value.

<h2 id="legacy-keyboardevent-events">Legacy {{KeyboardEvent}} events</h2>

	The <a><code>keypress</code></a> event is the traditional method for capturing key events
	and processing them before the DOM is updated with the effects of the key
	press. Code that makes use of the <a><code>keypress</code></a> event typically relies on
	the legacy {{KeyboardEvent/charCode}}, {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}}, and
	{{UIEvent/which}} attributes.

	Note that the <a><code>keypress</code></a> event is specific to key events, and has been
	replaced by the more general event sequence of <a><code>beforeinput</code></a> and
	<a><code>input</code></a> events. These new <code>input</code> events are not specific to
	keyboard actions and can be used to capture user input regardless of the
	original source.

			If supported by a <a>user agent</a>, this event MUST be dispatched
			when a key is pressed down, if and only if that key normally
			produces a <a>character value</a>. The <a><code>keypress</code></a> event type is
			device dependent and relies on the capabilities of the input devices
			and how they are mapped in the operating system.

			This event type MUST be generated after the <a>key mapping</a>. It
			MUST NOT be fired when using an <a>input method editor</a>.

			If this event is canceled, it should prevent the <a><code>input</code></a> event

			<p class="note">
			The <a><code>keypress</code></a> event is traditionally associated with detecting

<h2 id="legacy-event-initializers">Legacy Event Initializers</h2>

	<em>This section is normative.</em>

	The following features are obsolete and should only be implemented by
	<a>user agents</a> that require compatibility with legacy software.</em>

	Early versions of this specification included an initialization method on
	the interface (for example <code>initMouseEvent</code>) that required a long
	list of parameters that, in most cases, did not fully initialize all
	attributes of the event object. Because of this, event interfaces which were
	derived from the basic {{Event}} interface required that the initializer of
	<em>each</em> of the derived interfaces be called explicitly in order to
	fully initialize an event.

	<div class="example">
	Initializing all the attributes of a UIEvent requires calls to two
	initializer methods: <code>initEvent</code> and
	<code>initUIEvent</code>.
	</div>

	Due in part to the length of time in the development of this standard, some
	implementations MAY have taken a dependency on these (now deprecated)
	initializer methods. For completeness, these legacy event initializers are
	described in this section.

<h2 id="legacy-key-attributes">Legacy Key &amp; Mouse Event Attributes</h2>

	<em>This section is non-normative. The following attributes are obsolete and should
	only be implemented by <a>user agents</a> that require compatibility with legacy
	software that requires these keyboard events.</em>

	These features were never formally specified and the current browser
	implementations vary in significant ways.

	<h3 id="legacy-KeyboardEvent">Legacy {{KeyboardEvent}} supplemental interface</h3>

		<em>This section is non-normative</em>

		Browser support for keyboards has traditionally relied on three ad-hoc
		attributes, {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}}, {{KeyboardEvent/charCode}}, and
		{{UIEvent}}'s {{UIEvent/which}}.

		All three of these attributes return a numerical code that represents some
		aspect of the key pressed: {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} is an index of the key
		itself. {{KeyboardEvent/charCode}} is the ASCII value of the character keys.
		{{UIEvent/which}} is the character value where available and otherwise
		the key index. The values for these attributes, and the availability of the
		attribute, is inconsistent across platforms, keyboard languages and layouts,
		<a>user agents</a>, versions, and even event types.

		<h4 id="legacy-interface-KeyboardEvent">Interface KeyboardEvent (supplemental)</h4>

			The partial {{KeyboardEvent}} interface is an informative extension of
			the {{KeyboardEvent}} interface, which adds the
			{{KeyboardEvent/charCode}} and {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} attributes.

			The partial {{KeyboardEvent}} interface can be obtained by using the
			{{Document/createEvent()}} method call in
			implementations that support this extension.

			<pre class="idl">
			partial interface KeyboardEvent {
			  // The following support legacy user agents
			  readonly attribute unsigned long charCode;
			  readonly attribute unsigned long keyCode;
			};
			</pre>

			<dl dfn-for="KeyboardEvent">
				<dt><dfn attribute>charCode</dfn></dt>
				<dd>
					{{KeyboardEvent/charCode}} holds a character value, for
					<a><code>keypress</code></a> events which generate character input. The value
					is the Unicode reference number (code point) of that character
					(e.g. <code>event.charCode = event.key.charCodeAt(0)</code> for
					printable characters). For <a><code>keydown</code></a> or <a><code>keyup</code></a>

					these value of the {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} SHOULD represent
					the decimal codepoint in ASCII [[RFC20]][[US-ASCII]] or Windows
					1252 [[WIN1252]], but MAY be drawn from a different appropriate
					character set. Implementations that are unable to identify a key

	<h3 id="legacy-key-models">Legacy key models</h3>

		<em>This section is non-normative</em>

		Implementations differ on which values are exposed on these attributes for
		different event types. An implementation MAY choose to expose both virtual
		key codes and character codes in the {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} property
		(<em>conflated model</em>), or report separate {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} and
		{{KeyboardEvent/charCode}} properties (<em>split model</em>).

		<h4 id="determine-keydown-keyup-keyCode">How to determine {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} for <a><code>keydown</code></a> and <a><code>keyup</code></a> events</h4>

			The {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} for <a><code>keydown</code></a> or <a><code>keyup</code></a> events
			is calculated as follows:

			*	Read the virtual key code from the operating system's event
				information, if such information is available.

			*	If an Input Method Editor is processing key input and the event is
				<a><code>keydown</code></a>, return 229.

			*	If input key when pressed without modifiers would insert a numerical
				character (0-9), return the ASCII code of that numerical character.

			*	If input key when pressed without modifiers would insert a lower
				case character in the a-z alphabetical range, return the ASCII code
				of the upper case equivalent.

			*	If the implementation supports a key code conversion table for the
				operating system and platform, look up the value. If the conversion
				table specifies an alternate virtual key value for the given input,
				return the specified value.

			*	If the key's function, as determined in an implementation-specific
				way, corresponds to one of the keys in the
				[[#fixed-virtual-key-codes]] table, return the corresponding key
				code.

			*	Return the virtual key code from the operating system.

			*	If no key code was found, return 0.

		<h4 id="determine-keypress-keyCode">How to determine {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} for <a><code>keypress</code></a> events</h4>

			The {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} for <a><code>keypress</code></a> events is calculated
			as follows:

			*	If the implementation supports a <em>conflated model</em>, set
				{{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} to the Unicode code point of the character
				being entered.

			*	If the implementation supports a <em>split model</em>, set
				{{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} to 0.

	window or tab, a named window, or a new window). The activation behavior of
	an HTML <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with the <code>type</code>
	attribute value <code>submit</code> is be to send the values of the form
	elements to an author-defined IRI by the author-defined HTTP method.  See
	[[#event-flow-activation]] for more details.

: <dfn>activation trigger</dfn>
::	An event which is defined to initiate an <a>activation behavior</a>.  Refer
	to [[#event-flow-activation]] for more details.

: <dfn>body element</dfn>
::	In HTML or XHTML <a>documents</a>, the body element represents the contents of the
	document. In a well-formed HTML document, the body element is a first
	descendant of the <a>root element</a>.

: <dfn>character value</dfn>
::	In the context of key values, a character value is a string representing one
	or more Unicode characters, such as a letter or symbol, or a set of letters, each
	belonging to the set of valid <a>Unicode character categories</a>.
	In this specification, character values are denoted as a unicode string
	(e.g., <code class="unicode">U+0020</code>) or a glyph representation of the same code point (e.g.,
	<code class="glyph">"&nbsp;"</code>), and are color coded to help distinguish these two representations.

	<p class="note">
	In source code, some key values, such as non-graphic characters, can be
	represented using the character escape syntax of the programming language in
	use.
	</p>

: <dfn>dead key</dfn>
::	A dead key is a key or combination of keys which produces no character by
	itself, but which in combination or sequence with another key produces a
	modified character, such as a character with diacritical marks (e.g.,
	<code class="glyph">"&#xF6;"</code>, <code class="glyph">"&#xE9;"</code>, <code class="glyph">"&#xE2;"</code>).

: <dfn>default action</dfn>
::	A <a>default action</a> is an OPTIONAL supplementary behavior that an
	implementation MUST perform in combination with the dispatch of the event
	object.  Each event type definition, and each specification, defines the
	<a>default action</a> for that event type, if it has one.  An instance of an
	event MAY have more than one <a>default action</a> under some circumstances,
	such as when associated with an <a>activation trigger</a>.  A <a>default
	action</a> MAY be cancelled through the invocation of the
	{{Event/preventDefault()}} method. For more details, see
	[[#event-flow-default-cancel]].

: <dfn lt="deprecates|deprecated">deprecated</dfn>
::	Features marked as deprecated are included in the specification as reference
	to older implementations or specifications, but are OPTIONAL and
	discouraged.  Only features which have existing or in-progress replacements
	MUST be deprecated in this specification.  Implementations which do not
	already include support for the feature MAY implement deprecated features
	for reasons of backwards compatibility with existing content, but content
	authors creating content SHOULD NOT use deprecated features, unless there is
	no other way to solve a use case. Other specifications which reference this
	specification SHOULD NOT use deprecated features, but SHOULD point instead
	to the replacements of which the feature is deprecated in favor.  Features
	marked as deprecated in this specification are expected to be dropped from
	future specifications.

: <dfn>empty string</dfn>
::	The empty string is a value of type <code>DOMString</code> of length
	<code>0</code>, i.e., a string which contains no characters (neither
	printing nor control characters).

: <dfn>event</dfn>
::	An event is the representation of some occurrence (such as a mouse click on
	the presentation of an element, the removal of child node from an element,
	or any number of other possibilities) which is associated with its <a>event
	target</a>. Each event is an instantiation of one specific <a>event
	type</a>.

: <dfn>event target</dfn>
::	The object to which an <a>event</a> is targeted using the [[#event-flow]].
	The event target is the value of the {{Event/target}} attribute.

: <dfn>host language</dfn>
::	Any language which integrates the features of another language or API
	specification, while normatively referencing the origin specification rather
	than redefining those features, and extending those features only in ways
	defined by the origin specification.  An origin specification typically is
	only intended to be implemented in the context of one or more host
	languages, not as a standalone language.  For example, XHTML, HTML, and SVG
	are host languages for UI Events, and they integrate and extend the objects
	and models defined in this specification.

: <dfn>IME</dfn>
: <dfn>input method editor</dfn>
:: 	An <em>input method editor</em> (IME), also known as a <em>front end
	processor</em>, is an application that performs the conversion between
	keystrokes and ideographs or other characters, usually by user-guided
	dictionary lookup, often used in East Asian languages (e.g., Chinese,
	Japanese, Korean).  An <a>IME</a> MAY also be used for dictionary-based word
	completion, such as on mobile devices.  See [[#keys-IME]] for treatment of
	IMEs in this specification.  See also <a>text composition system</a>.

: <dfn>key mapping</dfn>
::	Key mapping is the process of assigning a key value to a particular key, and
	is the result of a combination of several factors, including the operating
	system and the keyboard layout (e.g., <a>QWERTY</a>, Dvorak, Spanish,
	InScript, Chinese, etc.), and after taking into account all <a>modifier
	key</a> (<code class="keycap">Shift</code>, <code class="keycap">Alt</code>, et al.) and <a>dead key</a> states.

: <dfn>key value</dfn>
::	A key value is a <a>character value</a> or multi-character string (such as
	<code class="key">"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/#key-Enter">Enter</a>"</code>, <code class="key">"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/#key-Tab">Tab</a>"</code>, or <code class="key">"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/#key-MediaTrackNext">MediaTrackNext</a>"</code>) associated with a key in a
	particular state. Every key has a key value, whether or not it has a
	<a>character value</a>. This includes control keys, function keys,
	<a>modifier keys</a>, <a>dead keys</a>, and any other key. The key value of
	any given key at any given time depends upon the <a>key mapping</a>.

: <dfn>modifier key</dfn>
::	A modifier key changes the normal behavior of a key, such as to produce a
	character of a different case (as with the <code class="keycap">Shift</code> key), or to alter
	what functionality the key triggers (as with the <code class="keycap">Fn</code> or <code class="keycap">Alt</code>
	keys). See [[#keys-modifiers]] for more information about modifier keys and
	refer to the [=Modifier Keys table=] in [[UIEvents-Key]] for a list
	of valid modifier keys.

: <dfn>QWERTY</dfn>
::	QWERTY (pronounced <q>&#x2C8;kw&#x25C;rti</q>) is a common keyboard layout,
	so named because the first five character keys on the top row of letter keys
	are Q, W, E, R, T, and Y.  There are many other popular keyboard layouts
	(including the Dvorak and Colemak layouts), most designed for localization
	or ergonomics.

: <dfn>text composition system</dfn>
::	A software component that interprets some form of alternate input (such as a
	<a>input method editor</a>, a speech processor, or a handwriting recognition
	system) and converts it to text.

: <dfn>Unicode character categories</dfn>
:: A subset of the General Category values that are defined for each Unicode
	code point. This subset contains all the
	Letter (<abbr title="Letter, Lowercase">Ll</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Letter, Modifier">Lm</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Letter, Other">Lo</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Letter, Titlecase">Lt</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Letter, Uppercase">Lu</abbr>),
	Number (<abbr title="Number, Decimal Digit">Nd</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Number, Letter">Nl</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Number, Other">No</abbr>),
	Punctuation (<abbr title="Punctuation, Connector">Pc</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Punctuation, Dash">Pd</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Punctuation, Close">Pe</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Punctuation, Final quote">Pf</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Punctuation, Initial quote">Pi</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Punctuation, Other">Po</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Punctuation, Open">Ps</abbr>)
	and Symbol (<abbr title="Symbol, Currency">Sc</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Symbol, Modifier">Sk</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Symbol, Math">Sm</abbr>,
		<abbr title="Symbol, Other">So</abbr>)
	category values.

: <dfn>un-initialized value</dfn>
::	The value of any event attribute (such as {{Event/bubbles}} or
	{{Event/currentTarget}}) before the event has been initialized with
	{{Event/initEvent()}}. The un-initialized values of an event apply
	immediately after a new event has been created using the method
	{{Document/createEvent()}}.

: <dfn>user agent</dfn>
::	A program, such as a browser or content authoring tool, normally running on
	a client machine, which acts on a user's behalf in retrieving, interpreting,
	executing, presenting, or creating content.  Users MAY act on the content
	using different user agents at different times, for different purposes.  See
	the [[#conf-interactive-ua]] and [[#conf-author-tools]] for details on the
	requirements for a <em>conforming</em> user agent.

: <dfn>Window</dfn>
::	The <code>Window</code> is the object referred to by the current <a>document</a>'s
	browsing context's Window Proxy object as defined in
	<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#windowproxy" title="HTML5 WindowProxy description">HTML5</a>
	[[HTML5]].
