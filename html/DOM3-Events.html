	<!-- Section 1: DOM3 Events Overview  ========================================================-->
	<section id="dom-events">
		<h1>Document Object Model Events</h1>
		
		<section id="dom-events-overview">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>DOM Events is designed with two main goals. The first goal is the design of an <a class="def" href="#glossary-event">event</a> system which allows registration
				of event listeners and describes event flow through a tree structure. Additionally, the specification will provide standard modules of events for user interface
				control and document mutation notifications, including defined contextual information for each of these event modules.</p>

			<p>The second goal of DOM Events is to provide a common subset of the current event systems used in existing browsers. This is intended to foster interoperability
				of existing scripts and content. It is not expected that this goal will be met with full backwards compatibility. However, the specification attempts to achieve
				this when possible.</p>
		</section>  <!-- dom-events-overview -->

		<section id="dom-events-conformance">
			<h2>Conformance</h2>
			<p><strong>This section is normative.</strong></p>

			<p>Within this specification, the key words <q>MUST</q>, <q>MUST NOT</q>, <q>REQUIRED</q>,
				<q>SHALL</q>, <q>SHALL NOT</q>, <q>SHOULD</q>, <q>SHOULD NOT</q>,
				<q>RECOMMENDED</q>, <q>MAY</q>, and <q>OPTIONAL</q> are to be interpreted as described in
				[<a href="#RFC2119">RFC2119</a>].</p>

			<p>This specification is to be understood in the context of the DOM Level 3 Core specification [<cite><a class="normative" href="#references-DOMCore">DOM3 Core</a></cite>]
				and the general considerations for DOM implementations apply. For example, handling of <a class="def" href="#glossary-namespaceURI">namespace URIs</a> is discussed in
				<a class="normative" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#Namespaces-Considerations"><em>XML Namespaces</em></a>. For additional information about
				<a class="normative" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/introduction.html#ID-Conformance"><em>conformance</em></a>, please see the DOM Level 3 Core specification
				[<cite><a class="normative" href="#references-DOMCore">DOM3 Core</a></cite>].  A <a class="def" href="#glossary-user-agent">user agent</a> is not required to conform
				to the entirety of another specification in order to conform to this specification, but it MUST conform to the specific parts of any other specification which are called
				out in this specification (e.g., a conforming DOM3 Events <a class="def" href="#glossary-user-agent">user agent</a> MUST support the <code>DOMString</code> data type as defined
				in <a href="#references-WebIDL">Web IDL</a>, but need not support every method or data type defined in <a href="#references-WebIDL">Web IDL</a> in order to conform
				to DOM3 Events).</p>

			<p>This specification defines several classes of conformance for different <a class="def" href="#glossary-user-agent">user agents</a>, specifications, and content authors:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt id="conf-interactive-ua">Web browsers and other dynamic or interactive <a class="def" href="#glossary-user-agent">user agents</a></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A dynamic or interactive <a class="def" href="#glossary-user-agent">user agent</a>, referred to
						here as a <q>browser</q> (be it a Web browser, AT (Accessibility Technology) application,
						or other similar program), conforms to DOM Level 3 Events if it supports:
						</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the Core module defined in
							[<cite><a class="normative" href="#references-DOMCore">DOM3 Core</a></cite>]
							</li>
						<li>the <a href="#event-flow">Event dispatch and DOM event flow</a> mechanism
							</li>
						<li>all the interfaces and events with their associated methods, attributes, and
							semantics defined in this specification with the exception of those marked as
							<a class="def" href="#glossary-deprecated">deprecated</a> (a conforming user
							agent MAY implement the deprecated interfaces, events, or APIs for backwards
							compatibility, but is not required to do so in order to be conforming)
							</li>
						<li>the complete set of <code>key</code> and <code>code</code> values defined in
							[<a href="#references-D3E-key">DOM3 key Values</a>] and
							[<a href="#references-D3E-code">DOM3 code Values</a>]
							(subject to platform availability), and
							</li>
						<li>all other normative requirements defined in this specification.
							</li>
					</ul>
					<p>A conforming browser MUST <a class="def" href="#glossary-dispatch">dispatch</a> events appropriate
						to the given <a href="#interface-EventTarget">EventTarget</a> when the conditions defined
						for that <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-type">event type</a> have been met.
						</p>

					<p><span id="conform-arch">A browser conforms specifically to the DOM Level 3 Events Architecture if it implements the <a href="#dom-event-architecture">DOM Event
						Architecture</a> and <a href="#event-interfaces">Basic Event Interfaces</a>, regardless of its support for any other event interfaces or <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-type">
						event types</a> defined in this specification.</span>  <span id="conform-module">A browser conforms specifically to the DOM Level 3 Events Module if it implements
						the interfaces and its related <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-type">event types</a> specified in the <a href="#events-module">Events Module</a>, and to each
						event interface if it implements that interface and its related <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-type">event types</a>.</span></p>

					<p><span id="conform-script">A conforming browser MUST support scripting, declarative interactivity, or some other means of detecting and dispatching events in the manner
						described by this specification, and MUST support the APIs specified for that <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-type">event type</a>.</span></p>

					<p>In addition to meeting all other conformance criteria, a conforming browser MAY implement features of this specification marked as <a class="def" href="#glossary-deprecated">
						deprecated</a>, for backwards compatibility with existing content, but such implementation is discouraged.</p>

					<p>A conforming browser MAY also support features not found in this specification, but which use the <a href="#event-flow">Event dispatch and DOM event flow</a> mechanism,
						interfaces, events, or other features defined in DOM Level 3 Events, and MAY implement additional interfaces and <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-type">event types</a>
						appropriate to that implementation. Such features can be later standardized in future specifications.</p>

					<p>A browser which does not conform to all required portions of this specification MUST NOT claim conformance to DOM Level 3 Events.  Such an implementation which
						does conform to portions of this specification MAY claim conformance to those specific portions.</p>

					<p>A conforming browser MUST also be a <i>conforming implementation</i> of the IDL fragments in this specification, as described in the Web IDL specification. <a
						href="#references-WebIDL">[WEBIDL]</a></p>
				</dd>

				<dt id="conf-author-tools">Authoring tools</dt>

						conformance to DOM Level 3 Events for content it produces which uses features of this specification marked as <a class="def" href="#glossary-deprecated">deprecated</a>
						in this specification.  A conforming content authoring tool SHOULD provide to the content author a means to use all <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-type">event

						Architecture if it references and uses the <a href="#dom-event-architecture">DOM Event Architecture</a> and <a href="#event-interfaces">Basic Event Interfaces</a>,
						regardless of its use of any other event interfaces or <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-type">event types</a> defined in this specification.</p>

					<p>A specification or <a class="def" href="#glossary-host-language">host language</a> conforms specifically to the DOM Level 3 Events Module if it references and uses the interfaces and

	<!-- Section 2: Glossary  ========================================================-->
	<section id="glossary">
		<h1>Glossary</h1>

		<p class="1st">Some of the following term definitions have been borrowed or modified from similar definitions in other W3C or standards documents. See the links within
			the definitions for more information.</p>

		<dl id="glossary-list">
			<dt id="glossary-activation-behavior"><dfn>activation behavior</dfn></dt>
			<dd>The action taken when an <a class="def" href="#glossary-event">event</a>, typically initiated by users through an input device, causes an element to fulfill a
				defined task.  The task MAY be defined for that element by the <a class="def" href="#glossary-host-language">host language</a>, or by
				author-defined variables, or both.  The default task for any given element MAY be a generic action, or MAY be
				unique to that element.  For example, the activation behavior of an HTML or SVG <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element is to cause the
				<a class="def" href="#glossary-user-agent">user agent</a> to traverse the link specified in the <code>href</code> attribute, with the further optional parameter
				of specifying the browsing context for the traversal (such as the current window or tab, a named window, or a new window). The activation behavior of an HTML
				<code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with the <code>type</code> attribute value <code>submit</code> is be to send the values of the form elements to an
				author-defined IRI by the author-defined HTTP method.  See <a href="#event-flow-activation">Activation triggers and behavior</a> for more details.</dd>

			<dt id="glossary-activation-trigger"><dfn>activation trigger</dfn></dt>
			<dd>An event which is defined to initiate an <a class="def" href="#glossary-activation-behavior">activation behavior</a>.  Refer to <a href="#event-flow-activation">
				Activation triggers and behavior</a> for more details.</dd>

			<dt id="glossary-author"><dfn>author</dfn></dt>
			<dd>In the context of this specification, an <em>author</em>, <em>content author</em>, or <em>script author</em> is a person who writes script or other executable
				content that uses the interfaces, events, and event flow defined in this specification.  See <a href="#conf-authors">Content authors and content</a>  conformance
				category for more details.</dd>

			<dt id="glossary-bubbling-phase"><dfn>bubbling phase</dfn></dt>
			<dd>The process by which an <a class="def" href="#glossary-event">event</a> can be handled by one of the target's ancestors <em>after</em> being handled by the
				<a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">event target</a>. See the description of the <a href="#bubble-phase">bubble phase</a> in the context
				of event flow for more details.</dd>

			<dt id="glossary-capture-phase"><dfn>capture phase</dfn></dt>
			<dd>The process by which an <a class="def" href="#glossary-event">event</a> can be handled by one of the target's ancestors <em>before</em> being handled by the
				<a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">event target</a>. See the description of the <a href="#capture-phase">capture phase</a> in the context
				of event flow for more details.</dd>

			<dt id="glossary-candidate-event-handlers"><dfn>candidate event handlers</dfn></dt>
			<dt><dfn>candidate event listeners</dfn></dt>
			<dd>The list of all <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-handler">event listeners</a> that have been registered on the target object in their order of registration. This
				list is captured or <q>frozen</q> before event listeners on the target object are dispatched, and released or <q>un-frozen</q> after this set of candidate event
				handlers have been dispatched (allowing these event listeners to add or remove additional listeners on other objects in an event's propagation chain, but not affect
				the order of listeners that will be invoked on the target object).

				<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Initially capturing the candidate event handlers prevents infinite loops of event listener dispatch on a given target object.</p>
			</dd>

			<dt id="glossary-character-value"><dfn>character value</dfn></dt>
			<dd>In the context of key values, a character value is a string representing one or more Unicode characters, such as a letter or symbol, or a set of letters. In this
				specification, character values are denoted as a unicode string (e.g., <code class="char">'\u0020'</code>) or a glyph representation of the same code point (e.g.,
				<code class="glyph">' '</code>), and are color coded to help distinguish these two representations.
				<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> In source code, some key values, such as non-graphic characters, can be represented using
				the character escape syntax of the programming language in use.</p>
			</dd>

			<dt id="glossary-current-event-target"><dfn>current event target</dfn></dt>
			<dd>In an event flow, the current event target is the object associated with the <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-handler">event handler</a> that is currently being
				dispatched. This object MAY be the <a href="#glossary-event-target">event target</a> itself or one of its ancestors. The current event target changes as the
				<a class="def" href="#glossary-event">event</a> propagates from object to object through the various <a class="def" href="#glossary-phase">phases</a> of the event flow.
				The current event target is the value of the <a href="#widl-Event-currentTarget"><code>Event.currentTarget</code></a> attribute.</dd>

			<dt id="glossary-dead-key"><dfn>dead key</dfn></dt>
			<dd>A dead key is a key or combination of keys which produces no character by itself, but which in combination or sequence with another key produces a modified character,
				such as a character with diacritical marks (e.g., <code>&#xF6;</code>, <code>&#xE9;</code>, <code>&#xE2;</code>).</dd>

			<dt id="glossary-default-action"><dfn>default action</dfn></dt>
			<dd>A <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default action</a> is an OPTIONAL supplementary behavior that an implementation
				MUST perform in combination with the dispatch of the event object.  Each event type definition, and each specification, defines the
				<a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default action</a> for that event type, if it has one.  An instance of an event MAY have more than
				one <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default action</a> under some circumstances, such as when associated with an
				<a class="def" href="#glossary-activation-trigger">activation trigger</a>.  A <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action"> default action</a> MAY
				be cancelled through the invocation of the <a href="#widl-Event-preventDefault"><code>Event.preventDefault()</code></a> method. For more details, see
				<a href="#event-flow-default-cancel">Default actions and cancelable events</a>.</dd>

			<dt id="glossary-delta"><dfn>delta</dfn></dt>
			<dd>The estimated scroll amount (in pixels, lines, or pages) that the user agent will scroll or zoom the page in response to the physical movement of an input device that
				supports the <code>WheelEvent</code> interface (such as a mouse wheel or touch pad). The value of a <a class="def" href="#glossary-delta">delta</a> (e.g., the <a
				href="#widl-WheelEvent-deltaX">deltaX</a>, <a href="#widl-WheelEvent-deltaY">deltaY</a>, or <a href="#widl-WheelEvent-deltaZ">deltaZ</a> attributes) is to be
				interpreted in the context of the current <a href="#widl-WheelEvent-deltaMode"><code>deltaMode</code></a> property. The relationship between the physical movement of
				a wheel (or other device) and whether the <a class="def" href="#glossary-delta">delta</a> is positive or negative is environment and device dependent. However, if a user
				agent scrolls as the <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default action</a> then the sign of the <a class="def" href="#glossary-delta">delta</a> is given by a
				right-hand coordinate system where positive X,Y, and Z axes are directed towards the right-most edge, bottom-most edge, and farthest depth (away from the user) of the
				document, respectively.</dd>

			<dt id="glossary-deprecated"><dfn>deprecated</dfn></dt>
			<dd>Features marked as deprecated are included in the specification as reference to older implementations or specifications, but are OPTIONAL
				and discouraged.  Only features which have existing or in-progress replacements MUST be deprecated in this specification.  Implementations
				which do not already include support for the feature MAY implement deprecated features for reasons of backwards compatibility with existing
				content, but content authors creating content SHOULD NOT use deprecated features, unless there is no other way to solve a use case.
				Other specifications which reference this specification SHOULD NOT use deprecated features, but SHOULD
				point instead to the replacements of which the feature is deprecated in favor.  Features marked as deprecated in this specification are expected to be dropped from
				future specifications.</dd>

			<dt id="glossary-dispatch"><dfn>dispatch</dfn></dt>
			<dd>To create an event with attributes and methods appropriate to its type and context, and propagate it through the DOM tree in the specified manner. Interchangeable
				with the term <q><a href="#glossary-fire">fire</a></q>, e.g., <q>fire a <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event</q> or <q>dispatch

			<dt id="glossary-event"><dfn>event</dfn></dt>
			<dd>An event is the representation of some occurrence (such as a mouse click on the presentation of an element, the removal of child node from an element, or any number

			<dt id="glossary-event-focus"><dfn>event focus</dfn></dt>
			<dd>Event focus is a special state of receptivity and concentration on an particular element or other <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">event target</a> within

				(the <a class="def" href="#glossary-current-event-target">current event target</a>) and are provided with the event object itself.

				<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>In JavaScript, user-defined functions are considered to implement the <a href="#interface-EventListener"><code>EventListener</code></a> interface. Thus the
					event object will be provided as the first parameter to the user-defined function when it is invoked. Additionally, JavaScript objects can also implement

			</dd>

			<dt id="glossary-event-order"><dfn>event order</dfn></dt>
			<dd>The sequence in which events from the same event source or process occur, using the same or related event interfaces. For example, in an environment with a mouse,
				a track pad, and a keyboard, each of those input devices would constitute a separate event source, and each would follow its own event order. A <a class="eventtype"
				href="#event-type-mousedown"><code>mousedown</code></a> event from the trackpad followed by a <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mouseup"><code>mouseup</code></a>
				event from the mouse would not result in a <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event.

				<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> There can be interactions between different event orders. For example, a <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event might
				be modified by a concurrent <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-keydown"><code>keydown</code></a> event (<code class="key">'Shift'</code><code>+click</code>). However, the event orders
				of these different event sources would be distinct.</p>

				The event order of some interfaces are device-independent. For example, a user might change focus using the <a href="#key-Tab"><code class="key">'Tab'</code></a>
				key, or by clicking the new focused element with the mouse.  The event order in such cases depends on the state of the process, not on the state of the device that

		<section id="event-flow">
			<h2>Event dispatch and DOM event flow</h2>

			<p>This section defines the event <a class="def" href="#glossary-dispatch">dispatch</a> mechanism of the event model defined in this specification.
				Applications MAY dispatch event objects using the <a href="#widl-EventTarget-dispatchEvent"><code>EventTarget.dispatchEvent()</code></a> method, and
				implementations MUST dispatch event objects as if through this method. The behavior of this method depends on the <em>event flow</em>
				associated with the underlying object. An event flow describes how event objects <em>propagate</em> through a data structure. As an example, when an event object
				is dispatched to an element in an XML document, the object propagates through parts of the document, as determined by the DOM event flow which is defined at the
				end of this section.</p>

			<figure id="figure-dom-event-flow">
				<img src='images/eventflow.svg' width="520" height="560" />
				<figcaption>Graphical representation of an event dispatched in a DOM tree using the DOM event flow</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>Event objects are dispatched to an <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">event target</a>. At the beginning
				of the dispatch, implementations MUST first determine the event object's <a class="def" href="#glossary-propagation-path">propagation path</a>.</p>

			<p>The propagation path MUST be an ordered list of <a class="def" href="#glossary-current-event-target">current event targets</a> through which
				the event object MUST pass. For DOM implementations, the propagation path MUST reflect the hierarchical tree
				structure of the document. The last item in the list MUST be the <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">event target</a>. The
				preceding items in the list are referred to as the <em>target's ancestors</em>, and the immediately preceding item as the <em>target's parent</em>. Once determined, the
				propagation path MUST NOT be changed. For DOM implementations, this applies even if an element in the propagation path is moved within the
				DOM or removed from the DOM.</p>

			<div class="example">
				<div class="example-title"></div>
				<p>In the DOM event flow, event listeners might change the position of the <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">
				event target</a> in the document while the event object is being dispatched. Such changes do not affect the propagation path.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Exceptions thrown inside event listeners MUST NOT stop the propagation of the event or affect the
				<a class="def" href="#glossary-propagation-path">propagation path</a>. The exception itself MUST NOT propagate outside the scope of the event
				handler.</p>

			<div class="example">
				<div class="example-title"></div>
				<p>In the following code, the exception thrown from the call to <code>throw "Error"</code> does not propagate into the parent scope
				(which would prevent the <code>console.log</code> statement from executing):</p>
<pre>var e = document.createEvent("Event");
e.initEvent("myevent", false, false);
var target = document.createElement("div");
target.addEventListener("myevent", function () {
   throw "Error";
});
target.dispatchEvent(e); <span class="comment">// Causes the event listener to throw an exception...</span>
<span class="comment">// The previously thrown exception doesn't affect the code that follows:</span>
console.log("Exceptions? No problem");</pre>
			</div>

			<p id="event-phase">As the next step, the event object MUST complete one or more <a class="def" href="#glossary-phase">event phases</a>. This specification defines
				three event phases: <a href="#capture-phase">capture phase</a>, <a href="#target-phase">target phase</a> and <a href="#bubble-phase">bubble phase</a>.  Event objects
				complete these phases in the specified order using the partial propagation paths as defined below. A phase MUST be skipped if it is not
				supported, or if the event object's propagation has been stopped. For example, if the <a href="#widl-Event-bubbles"><code>Event.bubbles</code></a>
				attribute is set to false, the bubble phase will be skipped, and if <a href="#widl-Event-stopPropagation"><code>Event.stopPropagation()</code></a> has been
				called prior to the dispatch, all phases MUST be skipped.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The <strong id="capture-phase">capture phase</strong>: The event object MUST propagate through the target's ancestors from the <a class="def"
					href="#glossary-window">Window</a> to the target's parent. This phase is also known as the <em>capturing phase</em>. Event
					listeners registered for this phase MUST handle the event before it reaches its target.</li>

				<li>The <strong id="target-phase">target phase</strong>: The event object MUST arrive at the event object's <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">
					event target</a>. This phase is also known as the <em>at-target phase</em>. Event listeners registered for this phase MUST
					handle the event once it has reached its target. If the <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-type">event type</a> indicates that
					the event MUST NOT bubble, the event object MUST halt after completion of this phase.</li>

				<li>The <strong id="bubble-phase">bubble phase</strong>: The event object propagates through the target's ancestors in reverse order, starting
					with the target's parent and ending with the <a class="def" href="#glossary-window">Window</a>. This phase is also known as the <em>bubbling phase</em>.
					Event listeners registered for this phase MUST handle the event after it has reached its target.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Implementations MUST let event objects accomplish an event phase by applying the following steps while there are pending event targets in
				the partial propagation path for this phase and the event object's propagation has not been stopped through <a href="#widl-Event-stopPropagation"><code>
				Event.stopPropagation()</code></a>.</p>

			<p>First, the implementation MUST determine the <em>current target</em>. This MUST be the next pending event target in the partial propagation
				path, starting with the first. From the perspective of an event listener this MUST be the event target the listener has been registered on.</p>

			<p>Next, the implementation MUST determine the current target's <a class="def" href="#glossary-candidate-event-handlers">candidate event listeners</a>.
				This MUST be the list of all event listeners that have been registered on the current target in their order of registration. [<cite><a class="informative"
				href="#references-HTML5">HTML5</a></cite>] defines the ordering of listeners registered through event handler attributes. Once determined, the candidate event listeners
				MUST NOT be changed. Adding or removing listeners does not affect the current target's candidate event listeners.</p>

			<p>Finally, the implementation MUST process all candidate <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-handler">event handlers</a> in order and trigger
				each handler if all the following conditions are met:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The event object's immediate propagation has not been stopped.</li>

				<li>The listener has been registered for this event phase.</li>

				<li>The listener has been registered for this <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-type">event type</a>.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>In the production of the <a class="def" href="#glossary-propagation-path">propagation path</a>, the event propagates from the <a class="def" href="#glossary-window">Window</a>
				to the <code>document</code> object during the <a class="def" href="#glossary-capture-phase">capture phase</a>, and from the <code>document</code> object to the
				<a class="def" href="#glossary-window">Window</a> during the <a class="def" href="#glossary-bubbling-phase">bubble phase</a>.</p>

			<p>After an event completes all the phases of its <a class="def" href="#glossary-propagation-path">propagation path</a>, its <a href="#widl-Event-currentTarget">
				<code>Event.currentTarget</code></a> MUST be set to <code>null</code> and the <a href="#widl-Event-eventPhase"><code>Event.eventPhase</code></a> MUST be
				set to <code>0</code> (<a href="#widl-Event-NONE"><code>NONE</code></a>). All other attributes of the <code>Event</code> (or interface derived from <code>Event</code>)
				are unchanged (including the <a href="#widl-Event-target"><code>Event.target</code></a> attribute, which MUST continue to reference the <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">
				event target</a>).</p>

			<p>The model defined above MUST be applied regardless of the specific event flow associated with an event target. Each event flow MUST define how the propagation path
				MUST be determined and which event phases are supported. The <em>DOM event flow</em> is an application of this model: the propagation path for a <code>Node</code>
				object MUST be determined by its <code>Node.parentNode</code> chain, and if applicable, the document's containing <a class="def" href="#glossary-window">Window</a>.
				All events accomplish the capture and target phases. Whether an event accomplishes the bubble phase MUST be defined individually for each <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-type">
				event type</a>. An alternate application of this model can be found in [<cite><a class="informative" href="#references-DOMLS">DOM3 Load and Save</a></cite>].</p>

			<p>Implementations of the DOM event model MUST be reentrant. Event listeners MAY perform actions that cause additional events to be dispatched. Such events are handled

			<h2>Default actions and cancelable events</h2>

			<p>Events are typically dispatched by the implementation as a result of a user action, in response to the completion of a task, or to signal progress during asynchronous
				activity (such as a network request). Some events can be used to control the behavior that the implementation MAY take next (or undo an action that the implementation
				already took). Events in this category are said to be <em>cancelable</em> and the behavior they cancel is called their <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">
				<em>default action</em></a>. Cancelable event objects can be associated with one or more <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default actions</a>.
				To cancel an event, call the <a href="#widl-Event-preventDefault"><code>Event.preventDefault()</code></a> method.</p>

			<div class="example">
				<div class="example-title"></div>
				<p>A <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mousedown"><code>mousedown</code></a> event is dispatched immediately after the user presses down a button on a
				pointing device (typically a mouse). One possible <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default action</a> taken by the implementation is to set up a state
				machine that allows the user to drag images or select text. The <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default action</a> depends on what happens next &mdash; for
				example, if the user's pointing device is over text, a text selection might begin. If the user's pointing device is over an image, then an image-drag action could
				begin. Preventing the <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default action</a> of a <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mousedown"><code>mousedown</code></a>
				event prevents these actions from occuring.</p>
			</div>

			<p><a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">Default actions</a> SHOULD be performed after the event dispatch has been completed, but in exceptional
				cases MAY also be performed immediately before the event is dispatched.</p>

			<div class="example">
				<div class="example-title"></div>
				<p>The default action associated with the <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event on <code>&lt;input
				type="checkbox"&gt;</code> elements toggles the <code>checked</code> IDL attribute value of that element. If the <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code>
				</a> event's default action is cancelled, then the value is restored to its former state.</p>
			</div>

			<p id="events-dt-cancelable-event">When an event is canceled, then the conditional <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default actions</a> associated with the event MUST be skipped (or
				as mentioned above, if the <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default actions</a> are carried out before the dispatch, their effect MUST be undone).
				Whether an event object is cancelable MUST be indicated by the <a href="#widl-Event-cancelable"><code>Event.cancelable</code></a> attribute. <a href="#widl-Event-preventDefault">
				<code>Event.preventDefault()</code></a> stops all related <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default actions</a> of an event object. The <a href="#widl-Event-defaultPrevented">
				<code>Event.defaultPrevented</code></a> attribute indicates whether an event has already been canceled (e.g., by a prior event listener). If the <a class="def" href="#glossary-DOM-application">
				DOM application</a> itself initiated the dispatch, then the return value of the <a href="#widl-EventTarget-dispatchEvent"><code>EventTarget.dispatchEvent()</code></a>
				method indicates whether the event object was cancelled.</p>

			<p class="note"><strong>Authoring Note: </strong>Many implementations additionally interpret an event listener's return value, such as the value <code>false</code>, to mean
				that the <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default action</a> of cancelable events will be cancelled (though <code>window.onerror</code> handlers are cancelled
				by returning <code>true</code>).</p>

			<p class="note"><strong>Authoring Note: </strong>Some cancelable events might not have any observable <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default actions</a>. For
				example, the <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mousemove"><code>mousemove</code></a> event.</p>

			<p>This specification does not offer features to programatically query if an event object has any <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default action</a> associated with
				it, or to associate new <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default actions</a> with an event object. Other specifications SHOULD define what default actions, if any,
				are associated with certain event objects. Further, implementations MAY associate <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default actions</a> with events as necessary and
				appropriate for that implementation.</p>

			<div class="example">
				<div class="example-title"></div>
				<p>As an example, one implementation might scroll a document view by a certain amount as the <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">
				default action</a> of a <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-wheel"><code>wheel</code></a> event, while another implementation might instead zoom the document as its <a class="def"

		<section id="sync-async">
			<h2>Synchronous and asynchronous events</h2>

			<p>Events MAY be dispatched either synchronously or asynchronously.</p>

			<p>Events which are synchronous (<em><q>sync events</q></em>) MUST be treated as if they are in a virtual queue in a first-in-first-out model, ordered by sequence
				of temporal occurrence with respect to other events, to changes in the DOM, and to user interaction.  Each event in this virtual queue MUST be delayed until the
				previous event has completed its propagation behavior, or been canceled.  Some sync events are driven by a specific device or process, such as mouse button events.
				These events are governed by the <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-order">event order</a> algorithms defined for that set of events, and a user agent MUST dispatch
				these events in the defined order.</p>

			<div class="example">
				<div class="example-title"></div>
				<p>A user double-clicks a passage of text to select a word, then presses the <code class="key">'Delete'</code>
				key to erase the word, triggering the following synchronous sequence of events:
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mousedown"><code>mousedown</code></a>,
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mouseup"><code>mouseup</code></a>,
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a>,
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mousedown"><code>mousedown</code></a>,

					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a>,
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-dblclick"><code>dblclick</code></a>,
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-select"><code>select</code></a>,
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-keydown"><code>keydown</code></a>,
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-beforeinput"><code>beforeinput</code></a>,
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-input"><code>input</code></a>,
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-keyup"><code>keyup</code></a>.
				Each of these events are fired in the sequence initiated by the user's actions.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Events which are asynchronous (<em><q>async events</q></em>) MAY be dispatched as the results of the action are completed, with no relation to other events, to
				other changes in the DOM, nor to user interaction.</p>

			<div class="example">
				<div class="example-title"></div>
				<p>During loading of a document, an inline script element is parsed and executed. The <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-load">
				<code>load</code></a> event is queued to be fired asynchronously at the script element. However, because it is an async event, its order with relation to other synchronous
				events fired during document load (such as the <code class="eventtype">DOMContentLoaded</code> event from <cite><a class="informative" href="#references-HTML5">HTML5</a></cite>) is not guaranteed.</p>

			<section id="event-order-and-loops">
				<h3>Event order and event loops</h3>

				<p>Most events take place in a sequential context.  [<cite><a class="informative" href="#references-HTML5">HTML5</a></cite>] defines its event operations in terms
					of an event loop mechanism, in which events of all types are fed into different <em>task queues</em>.  This specification does not define events in terms of this
					event loop mechanism, but it is compatible with this mechanism.  Instead, this specification defines several operation-specific <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-order">
					event orders</a>.</p>

				<p>Using the terminology of HTML5, each independent device, such as a mouse or keyboard, SHOULD be treated as a <em>task source</em> which feeds into the appropriate
					<em>task queue</em>, in the order defined by the <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-order">event order</a> associated with that device. Each operation, such as
					a focus change or composition input, also acts as a <em>task source</em> for the appropriate <em>task queue</em>.  The resolution of these event loops is handled
					in a manner conforming to the <a class="def" href="#glossary-host-language">host language</a>, such as HTML [<cite><a class="informative" href="#references-HTML5">HTML5</a></cite>].</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>Authoring Note:</strong> Certain events, such as <q>hotkeys</q> or control keys pressed in a certain sequence, can be

			<h2>Activation triggers and behavior</h2>

			<p>A <a class="def" href="#glossary-host-language">host language</a> SHOULD indicate which, if any, elements have activation behavior, describe appropriate <a class="def"

				href="#glossary-host-language">host language</a> SHOULD initiate these <a class="def" href="#glossary-activation-behavior">activation behavior</a> when the associated
				<a class="def" href="#glossary-activation-trigger">activation trigger</a> occurs.</p>

			<div class="example" id="example-activation">
				<div class="example-title"></div>
				<p>Both HTML and SVG have an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element which indicates a link.  Relevant <a

				event with a <a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-key">key</a> attribute value of <a href="#key-Enter"><code class="key">'Enter'</code></a> key when the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>

				in the case of external links, or to reposition the current document relative to the new anchor, in the case of internal links.</p>
			</div>

			<p>An <a class="def" href="#glossary-activation-trigger">activation trigger</a> is a user action or an event which indicates to the implementation that an activation

			<h2>Interface EventTarget</h2>

			<p class="intro-dom">Introduced in DOM Level 2</p>

			<p>The <code>EventTarget</code> interface allows registration and removal of event listeners, and dispatch of events to an event target.</p>

			<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Though an event listener can be registered for any <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">event
				target</a> node, the user agent only dispatches UA-generated (trusted) events on node types that are defined as event target types for that specific event type
				(see the <a href="#event-types-list">List of DOM3 Event Types</a>). For example, a <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mouseover"><code>mouseover</code></a>
				event type registered on a text node will never be fired by the user agent, though a content author could dispatch an event of that type on the text node via script.</p>

			<p>When used with the DOM event flow, this interface MUST be implemented by all <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">event targets</a> and target ancestors,
				i.e., all DOM <code>Nodes</code> of the tree support this interface when the implementation conforms to DOM Level 3 Events and, therefore, this interface can be
				obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the <code>Node</code> interface.</p>

			<p>Invoking <code>addEventListener</code> (or <code>removeEventListener</code>) repeatedly on the same <code>EventTarget</code> with the same values for the parameters
				<code>type</code>, <code>listener</code>, and <code>useCapture</code> has no effect. Doing so does not cause the event listener to be registered more than once and
				does not cause a change in the triggering order.</p>

			<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>  In addition to the <a href="#widl-EventTarget-addEventListener">EventTarget.addEventListener</a> method, some
				<a class="def" href="#glossary-host-language">host languages</a> allow a content author to register event listeners by the use of attributes, e.g.,
				<code>onclick="handleClick()"</code> (see [<cite><a class="informative" href="#references-HTML5">HTML5</a></cite>] for further examples). Due to the
				language-specific details, this type of event listener registration is not defined in this specification. In general, many event types can be used as an attribute
				in this way by adding the prefix <em><code>on-</code></em> to the event type name. Dispatching events to these listeners is expected to behave consistently with the
				event registration and propagation defined in this specification, with the same interfaces, properties, and methods.</p>

					<p>The following is one way to interpret the above tables: the <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-load"><code>load</code></a> event will
					trigger event listeners attached on <code>Element</code> nodes for that event and on the capture and target phases. This event is not cancelable. If an event listener for the
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-load"><code>load</code></a> event is attached to a node other than <a class="def" href="#glossary-window"><code>Window</code></a>,
					<code>Document</code>, or <code>Element</code> nodes, or if it is attached to the bubbling phase only, this event listener would not be triggered.</p>
				</div>

					<h4>Document Focus and Focus Context</h4>

					<p>This event module includes event types for notification of changes in document
						<a class="def" href="#glossary-event-focus">focus</a>.
						There are three distinct focus contexts that are relevant to this discussion:
						</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>The <em>operating system focus context</em> which MAY be on one of many different applications currently
							running on the computer. One of these applications with focus can be a browser.
							</li>
						<li>When the browser has focus, the user can switch (such as with the tab key) the
							<em>application focus context</em> among the different browser user interface fields (e.g., the
							Web site location bar, a search field, etc.). One of these user interface fields can be the
							document being shown in a tab.
							</li>
						<li>When the document itself has focus, the <em>document focus context</em> can be set to any of the
							focusable elements in the document.
							</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The event types defined in this specification deal exclusively with document focus, and the
						<a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">event target</a> identified in the event details
						MUST only be part of the document or documents in the window, never a part of the browser or
						operating system, even when switching from one focus context to another.
						</p>
					
					<p>Normally, a document always has a focused element (even if it is the document element itself) and a persistent <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-focus-ring">focus
						ring</a>. When switching between focus contexts, the document's currently focused element and focus ring normally remain in their current state. For example,
						if a document has three focusable elements, with the second element focused, when a user changes operating system focus to another application and then back to
						the browser, the second element will still be focused within the document, and tabbing will change the focus to the third element.  A <a class="def" href="#glossary-host-language">
						host language</a> MAY define specific elements which might receive focus, the conditions under which an element MAY receive focus, the means by which
						focus MAY be changed, and the order in which the focus changes.  For example, in some cases an element might be given focus by moving a pointer over it, while other
						circumstances might require a mouse click. Some elements might not be focusable at all, and some might be focusable only by special means (clicking on the element),
						but not by tabbing to it.  Documents MAY contain multiple focus rings.  Other specifications MAY define a more complex focus model than is described in this specification,
						including allowing multiple elements to have the current focus.

								Though similarly named, the values for the <code>buttons</code> attribute

								The value of <code>button</code> is assumed to be valid during

								whereas the <code>buttons</code> attribute reflects the state of the

								(while it is being dispatched), because it can represent the
								"no button currently active" state (0).

							<p>The value of the <a href="#widl-MouseEvent-buttons"><code>MouseEvent.buttons</code></a>

							<ul>
								<li><code>0</code> MUST indicate no button is currently active.</li>
								<li><code>1</code> MUST indicate the primary button of the device
									(in general, the left button or the only button on single-button devices,
									used to activate a user interface control or select text).</li>
								<li><code>2</code> MUST indicate the secondary button
									(in general, the right button, often used to display a context menu), if present.</li>
								<li><code>4</code> MUST indicate the auxiliary button
									(in general, the middle button, often combined with a mouse wheel).</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Some pointing devices provide or simulate more buttons.
								To represent such buttons, the value MUST be doubled for each successive button

							<p class="note" id="buttons-mask"><strong>Note:</strong>
								Because the sum of any set of button values is a unique number, a content
								author can use a bitwise operation to determine how many buttons are currently

								For example, the value <code>3</code> indicates that the left and right button are

							<p>The <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event type MUST be dispatched on the
								<a class="def" href="#glossary-topmost-event-target">topmost event target</a> indicated by the pointer, when
								the user presses down and releases the primary pointer button,
								or otherwise activates the pointer in a manner that simulates such an action.
								The actuation method of the mouse button depends upon the pointer device and the environment configuration,
								e.g., it MAY depend on the screen location or the delay between the press and release of the pointing device button.
								</p>

							<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>click</code> event should only be fired for the primary
								pointer button (i.e., when <a href="#widl-MouseEvent-button"><code>MouseEvent.button</code></a> value is <code>0</code>,
								<a href="#widl-MouseEvent-buttons"><code>MouseEvent.buttons</code></a> value is <code>1</code>).
								Secondary buttons (like the middle or right button on a standard mouse) MUST NOT fire
								<code>click</code> events.
								</p>

							<p>The <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event MAY be preceded by the <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mousedown"><code>mousedown</code></a>
								and <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mouseup"><code>mouseup</code></a> events on the same element, disregarding changes between other node types (e.g., text
								nodes).  Depending upon the environment configuration, the <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event MAY be dispatched if one or
								more of the event types <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mouseover"><code>mouseover</code></a>, <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mousemove"><code>mousemove</code></a>,
								and <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mouseout"><code>mouseout</code></a> occur between the press and release of the pointing device button.  The <a class="eventtype"
								href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event MAY also be followed by the <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-dblclick"><code>dblclick</code></a>
								event.</p>

							<div class="example">
								<div class="example-title"></div>
								<p>If a user mouses down on a text node child of a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element which has been styled with
									a large line-height, shifts the mouse slightly such that it is no longer over an area containing text but is still within the containing block of that <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
									element (i.e., the pointer is between lines of the same text block, but not over the text node per se), then subsequently mouses up, this will likely still trigger
									a <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event (if it falls within the normal temporal <a class="def" href="#glossary-hysteresis">hysteresis</a> for a <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click">
									<code>click</code></a>), since the user has stayed within the scope of the same element. Note that user-agent-generated mouse events are not dispatched on text nodes.
								</p>
							</div>

							<p>In addition to being associated with pointer devices, the <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event type MUST be dispatched as
								part of an element activation, as described in <a href="#event-flow-activation">Activation triggers and behavior</a>.</p>

							<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For maximum accessibility, content authors are encouraged to use the
								<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event type when defining activation
								behavior for custom controls, rather than other pointing-device event types such as
								<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mousedown"><code>mousedown</code></a> or
								<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-mouseup"><code>mouseup</code></a>, which are more device-specific.
								Though the <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event type has its origins
								in pointer devices (e.g., a mouse), subsequent implementation
								enhancements have extended it beyond that association, and it can be considered a device-independent event
								type for element activation.
								</p>

							<p>The <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default action</a> of the
								<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event type varies
								based on the <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">event target</a> of the event and the value of the
								<a href="#widl-MouseEvent-button"><code>MouseEvent.button</code></a>
								or <a href="#widl-MouseEvent-buttons"><code>MouseEvent.buttons</code></a> attributes.
								Typical <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default actions</a>
								of the <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-click"><code>click</code></a> event type are as follows:
								</p>

							<ul>

								<li>If the <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">event target</a> is focusable, the <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default action</a> MUST be

				<h3>Wheel Event Types</h3>
				<p>Wheels are devices that can be rotated in one or more spatial dimensions, and which can be associated with a pointer device. The coordinate system depends on the
					environment configuration.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="example-title"></div>
					<p>The user's environment might be configured to associate vertical scrolling
						with rotation along the y-axis, horizontal scrolling with rotation along
						the x-axis, and zooming with rotation along the z-axis.
						</p>
				</div>

				<p>The deltaX, deltaY, and deltaZ attributes of
					<a href="#interface-WheelEvent"><code>WheelEvent</code></a> objects indicate a
					measurement along their respective axes in units of pixels, lines, or pages.
					The reported measurements are provided after an environment-specific algorithm
					translates the actual rotation/movement of the wheel device into the appropriate
					values and units.
					</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>Authoring Note:</strong>
					A user's environment settings can be customized to interpret actual rotation/movement
					of a wheel device in different ways.
					One movement of a common <q>dented</q> mouse wheel can produce a measurement of 162 pixels
					(162 is just an example value, actual values can depend on the current screen
					dimensions of the user-agent).
					But a user can change their default environment settings to speed-up their mouse wheel,
					increasing this number.
					Furthermore, some mouse wheel software can support acceleration (the faster the wheel
					is rotated/moved, the greater the <a class="def" href="#glossary-delta">delta</a> of each measurement) or even sub-pixel <a class="def" href="#glossary-rotation">rotation</a>
					measurements.
					Because of this, authors can not assume a given <a class="def" href="#glossary-rotation">rotation</a> amount in one user agent will
					produce the same <a class="def" href="#glossary-delta">delta</a> value in all user agents.
					</p>

				<p>The sign (positive or negative) of the values of the deltaX, deltaY, and deltaZ attributes
					MUST be consistent between multiple dispatches of the
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-wheel"><code>wheel</code></a> event while the
					motion of the actual wheel device is rotating/moving in the same direction.
					If a user agent scrolls as the default action of the
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-wheel"><code>wheel</code></a> event then the sign
					of the <a class="def" href="#glossary-delta">delta</a> SHOULD be given by a right-hand coordinate system where positive X,
					Y, and Z axes are directed towards the right-most edge, bottom-most edge, and farthest
					depth (away from the user) of the document, respectively.
					</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
					Individual user agents can (depending on their environment and hardware configuration)
					interpret the same physical user interaction on the wheel differently.
					For example, a vertical swipe on the edge of a trackpad from top to bottom can be
					interpreted as a wheel action intended to either scroll the
					page down or to pan the page up (i.e., resulting in either a positive or negative
					deltaY value respectively).

				<h3>Keyboard Event Types</h3>

				<p>Keyboard events are device dependent, i.e., they rely on the capabilities of the

					<a href="#keys">Keyboard events and key values</a> for more details, including
					examples on how Keyboard Events are used in combination with Composition Events.
					Depending on the

					</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>Authoring Note:</strong>
					Keyboard events are only one modality of providing textual input.
					For editing scenarios, consider also using the

					<h4>Interface KeyboardEvent</h4>

					<p class="intro-dom">Introduced in DOM Level 3</p>

					<p>The <a href="#interface-KeyboardEvent"><code>KeyboardEvent</code></a> interface
						provides specific contextual information associated with keyboard devices.
						Each keyboard event references a key using a value.
						Keyboard events are commonly directed at the element that has the focus.
						</p>

					<p>The <a href="#interface-KeyboardEvent"><code>KeyboardEvent</code></a> interface
						provides convenient attributes for some common modifiers keys:
							<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-ctrlKey"><code>KeyboardEvent.ctrlKey</code></a>,
							<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-shiftKey"><code>KeyboardEvent.shiftKey</code></a>,
							<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-altKey"><code>KeyboardEvent.altKey</code></a>,
							<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-metaKey"><code>KeyboardEvent.metaKey</code></a>.
						These attributes are equivalent to using the method
							<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-getModifierState"><code>KeyboardEvent.getModifierState(keyArg)</code></a>
						with
							<code class="key">'Control'</code>,
							<code class="key">'Shift'</code>,
							<code class="key">'Alt'</code>, or
							<code class="key">'Meta'</code>
						respectively.
						</p>

					<p>To create an instance of the <a href="#interface-KeyboardEvent"><code>KeyboardEvent</code></a>
						interface, use the
							<a href="#widl-DocumentEvent-createEvent"><code>DocumentEvent.createEvent("KeyboardEvent")</code></a>
						method call.

					<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
						Typically, any <a class="def" href="#glossary-default-action">default actions</a>

						</p>

					<p>The <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">event target</a> of a key event is
						the currently focused element which is processing the keyboard activity.
						This is often an HTML <code>input</code> element or a textual element which is editable,

						for non-text purposes, such as the activation of a hotkey or trigger of some other behavior.

					<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
						The <a class="def" href="#glossary-event-target">event target</a> might change between

						For example, a <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-keydown"><code>keydown</code></a>

				<h3>Composition Event Types</h3>

				<p>Composition Events provide a means for inputing text in a supplementary or alternate
					manner than by Keyboard Events, in order to allow the use of characters that
					might not be commonly available on keyboard.
					For example, Composition Events might be used
						to add accents to characters despite their absence from standard US keyboards,
						to build up logograms of many Asian languages from their base components or categories,
						to select word choices from a combination of key presses on a mobile device keyboard,
						or to convert voice commands into text using a speech recognition processor.
					Refer to <a href="#keys">Keyboard events and key values</a> for examples
					on how Composition Events are used in combination with keyboard events.
					</p>

				<p>Conceptually, a composition session consists of one
						<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-compositionstart"><code>compositionstart</code></a>
					event, one or more
						<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-compositionupdate"><code>compositionupdate</code></a>
					events, and one
						<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-compositionend"><code>compositionend</code></a>
					event, with the value of the <a href="#widl-CompositionEvent-data"><code>data</code></a>
					attribute persisting between each <q>stage</q> of this event chain during each session.
					</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
					While a composition session is active, keyboard events can be dispatched to the DOM
					if the keyboard is the input device used with the composition session.
					See the <a href="#event-type-compositionstart"><code>compositionstart</code> event details</a>
					and <a href="#keys-IME">IME section</a> for relevent event ordering.
					</p>

				<p>Not all <a class="def" href="#glossary-ime">IME</a> systems or devices expose the necessary
					data to the DOM, so the active composition string (the <q>Reading Window</q>
					or <q>candidate selection menu option</q>) might not be available through this interface,

			<h2>Keyboard Input</h2>

			<p><em>This section is informative</em></p>

			<p>The relationship of each key to the complete keyboard has three separate aspects,
				each of which vary among different models and configurations of keyboards, particularly
				for locale-specific reasons:
				</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Mechanical layout:</strong> the dimensions, size, and placement of the physical keys on the keyboard</li>
				<li><strong>Visual markings:</strong> the labels (or <em>legends</em>) that mark each key</li>
				<li><strong>Functional mapping:</strong> the abstract key-value association of each key.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This specification only defines the functional mapping, in terms of
					<a href="#keys-keyvalues"><code>key</code></a> values and
					<a href="#keys-codevalues"><code>code</code></a> values,
				but briefly describes
					<a href="#keyboard-layout">keyboard layout</a> and
					<a href="#key-legends">key legends</a>
				for background.
				</p>

			<section id="key-legends">
				<h3>Key Legends</h3>

				<p><em>This section is informative</em></p>

				<p>The key legend is the visual marking that is printed or embossed on the <em>key cap</em> (the rectangular
					'cap' that covers the mechanical switch for the key).
					These markings normally consist of one or more characters that a keystroke on that key
					will produce (such as
						<code class="glyph">'F'</code>,
						<code class="glyph">'8'</code>, or
						<code class="glyph">'ш'</code>),
					or names or symbols which indicate that key's function (such as an upward-pointing arrow
					<code class="glyph">&#x21E7;</code> indicating <code class="key">'Shift'</code>,
					or the string <code>'Enter'</code>).
					Keys are often referred to by this marking
					(e.g., <q>Press the <code>'Shift'</code> and <code>'F'</code> keys.</q>).
					Note, however, that the visual appearance of the key has no bearing on its digital representation,
					and in many configurations may be completely inaccurate.
					Even the control and function keys, such as <code>'Enter'</code>, MAY be mapped to different
					functionality, or even mapped as character keys.
					</p>

				<p>For historical reasons, the character keys are typically marked with the capital-letter equivalents
					of the character value they produce, e.g., the <code>'F'</code> key (the key marked with the glyph
					<code class="glyph">'F'</code>), will produce the character value <code class="char">'f'</code> when
					pressed without an active modifier key (<code class="key">'Shift'</code>) or modifier state
					(<code class="key">'CapsLock'</code>).
					</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
					Many keyboards contain keys that do not normally produce any characters, even though the symbol might
					have a Unicode equivalent.
					For example, the <code class="key">'Shift'</code> key might bear the symbol
					<code class="glyph">&#x21E7;</code>, which has the
					<a class="def" href="#glossary-unicode-code-point">Unicode code point</a> <code class="char">'\u21E7'</code>,
					but pressing the <code class="key">'Shift'</code> key will not produce this character value, and
					there is no <a class="def" href="#glossary-unicode-code-point">Unicode code point</a> for
					<code class="key">'Shift'</code>.
					</p>
			</section>  <!-- key-legends -->

		<section id="keys-codevalues">
			<h1>Key codes</h1>
			
			<p>A key <code>code</code> is an attribute of a keyboard event that can be used to identify the physical
				key associated with the keyboard event. It is similar to USB Usage IDs in that it provides
				a low-level value (similar to a scancode) that is vendor-neutral.
				</p>
				
			<p>The primary purpose of the <code>code</code> attribute is to provide a consistent and coherent way
				to identify keys based on their physical location. In addition, it also provides a stable name
				(unaffected by the current keyboard state) that uniquely identifies each key on the keyboard.
				</p>

			<p>The list of valid <code>code</code> values is defined in the
				DOM Level 3 KeyboardEvent code Values Specification [<a href="#references-D3E-code">DOM3 code Values</a>].
				</p>

			<section id="code-motivation">
				<h1>Motivation for Adding the <code>code</code> Attribute</h1>

				<p>As discussed in more detail later in this document, the standard PC keyboard has a set of keys (which
					we refer to as <em><a href="#key-alphanumeric-writing-system">writing system keys</a></em>)
					that generate different <code>key</code> values 
					based on the current keyboard layout selected by the user.
					This situation makes it difficult to write code that detects keys based on their physical
					location since the code would need to know which layout is in effect in order to know which
					<code>key</code> values to check for.
					A real-world example of this is a game that wants to use the
						<code class="keycap">'W'</code>,
						<code class="keycap">'A'</code>,
						<code class="keycap">'S'</code> and
						<code class="keycap">'D'</code>
					keys to control player movement.
					The <code>code</code> attribute solves this problem by providing
					a stable value to check that is <em>not affected by the current keyboard layout</em>.
					</p>
					
				<p>In addition, the values in the <code>key</code> attribute depend as well
					on the current keyboard state.
					Because of this, the order in which keys are pressed and released in relation to modifier keys
					can affect the values stored in the <code>key</code> attribute.
					The <code>code</code> attribute solves this problem by providing
					a stable value that is <em>not affected by the current keyboard state</em>.

			<h2>Keyboard Event <code>key</code> Values</h2>

			<p>A key value is a <code>DOMString</code> that can be used to indicate any given key on a keyboard, regardless of position or state, by the value it produces.  These
				key values MAY be used as return values for keyboard events generated by the implementation, or as input values by the content author to specify desired input (such
				as for keyboard shortcuts).
				</p>

			<p>The list of valid <code>key</code> values is defined in the
				DOM Level 3 KeyboardEvent key Values Specification [<a href="#references-D3E-key">DOM3 key Values</a>].
				</p>

			<p>Key values can be used to detect the value of a key which has been pressed, using the <a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-key"><code>KeyboardEvent.key</code></a>
				attribute.  Content authors can retrieve the <a class="def" href="#glossary-character-value">
				character value</a> of upper- or lower-case letters, number, symbols, or other character-producing keys, and also the <a class="def" href="#glossary-key-value">key
				value</a> of control keys, modifier keys, function keys, or other keys that do not generate characters. These values can be used for monitoring particular
				input strings, for detecting and acting on modifier key input in combination with other inputs (such as a mouse), for creating virtual keyboards, or for any number
				of other purposes.</p>

			<p>Key values can also be used by content authors in string comparisons, as values for markup attributes (such as the HTML <code>accesskey</code>) in conforming <a
				class="def" href="#glossary-host-language">host languages</a>, or for other related purposes.   A conforming <a class="def" href="#glossary-host-language">host language</a>
				SHOULD allow content authors to use either of the two equivalent string values for a key value: the <a class="def" href="#glossary-character-value">character value</a>,
				or the <a class="def" href="#glossary-key-value">key value</a>.</p>

			<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> While implementations will use the most relevant value for a key independently of the platform or keyboard layout mappings,
				content authors can not make assumptions on the ability of keyboard devices to generate them.  When using keyboard events and key values for shortcut-key combinations,
				content authors can <q>consider using numbers and function keys (F4, F5, and so on) instead of letters</q> ([<cite><a class="informative" href="#references-DWW95">DWW95</a></cite>])
				given that most keyboard layouts will provide keys for those.</p>

			<p>A key value does not indicate a specific key on the physical keyboard, nor does it reflect the character printed on the key. A key
				value indicates the current value of the event with consideration to the current state of all active keys and key input modes (including shift modes and <a class="def"
				href="#glossary-dead-key">dead keys</a>), as reflected in the operating-system mapping of the keyboard and reported to the implementation.  In other words, the
				key value for the key marked <code class="glyph">'O'</code> on a <a class="def" href="#glossary-qwerty">QWERTY</a> keyboard has the key value <code class="key">'o'</code> in an unshifted
				state, <code class="key">'O'</code> in a shifted state, <code class="key">'&#xF6;'</code> in an unshifted state during a dead-key operation to add an umlaut diacritic, and <code class="key">'&#xD6;'</code>
				in a shifted state during a dead-key operation to add an umlaut diacritic.  Because a user can map their keyboard to an arbitrary custom configuration, the content
				author is encouraged not to assume that a relationship exists between the shifted and unshifted states of a key and the majuscule form (uppercase or capital letters)
				and minuscule form (lowercase or small letters) of a character representation, but is encouraged instead to use the value of the <a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-key">
				<code>KeyboardEvent.key</code></a> attribute.  The keyboard depicted in <a href="#figure-keyboard">
				Figure 4</a> illustrates one possible set of <a class="def" href="#glossary-key-mapping">key mappings</a> on one possible keyboard layout. Many others exist,
				both standard and idiosyncratic.</p>

			<p>It is also important to note that there is not a one-to-one relationship between key event states and key values.  A particular key value might be associated with
				multiple keys. For example, many standard keyboards contain more than one key with the <code class="key">'Shift'</code> key value (normally distinguished by the
				<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-location"><code>KeyboardEvent.location</code></a> values <a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-DOM_KEY_LOCATION_LEFT"><code class="constant-name">DOM_KEY_LOCATION_LEFT</code></a>
				and <a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-DOM_KEY_LOCATION_RIGHT"><code class="constant-name">DOM_KEY_LOCATION_RIGHT</code></a>) or <code class="key">'8'</code> key value (normally
				distinguished by the <a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-location"><code>KeyboardEvent.location</code></a> values
				<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD"><code class="constant-name">DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD</code></a>
				and <a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD"><code class="constant-name">DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD</code></a>), and user-configured
				custom keyboard layouts MAY duplicate any key value in multiple key-state scenarios (note that <a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-location"><code>KeyboardEvent.location</code></a>
				is intended for standard keyboard layouts, and cannot always indicate a meaningful distinction).</p>

			<p>Finally, the meaning of any given character representation is context-dependent and complex.  For example, in some contexts, the asterisk (star) glyph (<code
				class="glyph">'*'</code>) represents a footnote or emphasis (when bracketing a passage of text). However, in some documents or executable programs it is equivalent
				to the mathematical multiplication operation, while in other documents or executable programs, that function is reserved for the multiplication symbol (<code class="glyph">'&#xD7;'</code>,
				Unicode value <code class="char">'\u00D7'</code>) or the Latin small letter <code>'x'</code> (due to the lack of a multiplication key on many keyboards
				and the superficial resemblance of the glyphs <code class="glyph">'&#xD7;'</code> and <code class="glyph">'x'</code>).  Thus, the semantic meaning or function of
				character representations is outside the scope of this specification.</p>

			<section id="keys-unicode">
				<h3>Key Values and Unicode</h3>

				<p>The <a class="def" href="#glossary-character-value">character values</a> described in this specification are Unicode [<a href="#references-Unicode">Unicode</a>]
					codepoints, and as such, have certain advantages.</p>

				<p>The most obvious advantage is that it allows the content author to use the full range of internationalized language functionality available in the implementation,
					regardless of the limitations of the text input devices on the system.  This opens up possibilities for virtual keyboards and Web-application-based <a class="def"
					href="#glossary-ime">input method editors</a>.</p>

				<p>Another benefit is that it allows the content author to utilize the Unicode general category properties programmatically.</p>

				<p>With legacy keyboard event attributes such as <code class="attribute-name">keyCode</code> and <code class="attribute-name">charCode</code>, content authors are forced to
					filter key input using cryptic, platform- and implementation-specific numeric codes, with poor internationalization, such as the following pseudocode:</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="example-title"></div>
<pre><code>if ( ( event.charCode == 45 || event.charCode == 36 ) ||
     ( event.charCode &gt;= 48 &amp;&amp; event.charCode &lt;= 57 ) ||
     ( event.charCode &gt;= 96 &amp;&amp; event.charCode &lt;= 105 ) ) {
   <span class="comment">// minus sign, dollar sign, and numeric characters from keyboard and numpad</span>
   <span class="comment">// ...</span>
}
else if ( ( event.charCode &gt;= 65 &amp;&amp; event.charCode &lt;= 90 ) ||
          ( event.charCode &gt;= 97 &amp;&amp; event.charCode &lt;= 122 ) ) {
   <span class="comment">// alphabetic characters from Latin character set, A-Z, a-z</span>
   <span class="comment">// ...</span>
}
else {
   <span class="comment">// ...</span>
}
</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>With key values and regular expressions, however, content authors can support selective and intuitive ranges for key-based input, in a cross-platform manner with
					advanced internationalization support, such as the following pseudocode:</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="example-title"></div>
<pre><code>if ( event.key == "-" || event.key.match("\p{Sc}") || event.key.match("\p{N}") ) {
   <span class="comment">// minus sign, any currency symbol, and numeric characters (regardless of key location)</span>
   <span class="comment">// ...</span>
}
else if ( event.key.match("\p{L}") ) {
   <span class="comment">// alphabetic characters from any language, upper and lower case</span>
   <span class="comment">// ...</span>
}
else {
   <span class="comment">// ...</span>
}
</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>In addition, because Unicode categorizes each assigned <a class="def" href="#glossary-unicode-code-point">code point</a> into a group of code points used by a particular
					human writing system, even more advanced capabilities are possible.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="example-title"></div>
					<p>A content author can match characters from a particular human script (e.g., Tibetan) using a regular expression such as
					<code>\p{Tibetan}</code>, to filter out other characters, or discover if a <a class="def" href="#glossary-unicode-code-point">code point</a> is in
					a certain code block (range of code points), using a regular expression like <code>\p{InCyrillic}</code>.</p>
				</div>

				<p>To facilitate this, implementations SHOULD support Unicode range detection using regular expressions, in a manner such as the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions
					(PCRE) [<a href="#references-pcre">PCRE</a>].</p>

			<section id="keys-modifiers">
				<h3>Modifier keys</h3>

				<p>Keyboard input uses modifier keys to change the normal behavior of a key.
					Like other keys, modifier keys generate
						<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-keydown"><code>keydown</code></a>
					and
						<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-keyup"><code>keyup</code></a>
					events, as shown in the example below.
					Some modifiers are activated while the key is being pressed down or maintained pressed such as
						<code class="key">'Alt'</code>,
						<code class="key">'Control'</code>,
						<code class="key">'Shift'</code>,
						<code class="key">'AltGraph'</code>,
					or
						<code class="key">'Meta'</code>.
					Others modifiers are activated depending on their state such as
						<code class="key">'CapsLock'</code>,
						<code class="key">'NumLock'</code>,
					or
						<code class="key">'ScrollLock'</code>.
					Change in the state happens when the modifier key is being pressed down.
					The
						<a href="#interface-KeyboardEvent"><code>KeyboardEvent</code></a>
					interface provides convenient attributes for some common modifiers keys:
						<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-ctrlKey"><code>KeyboardEvent.ctrlKey</code></a>,
						<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-shiftKey"><code>KeyboardEvent.shiftKey</code></a>,
						<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-altKey"><code>KeyboardEvent.altKey</code></a>,
						<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-metaKey"><code>KeyboardEvent.metaKey</code></a>.
					Some operating systems simulate the
						<code class="key">'AltGraph'</code>
					modifier key with the combination of the
						<code class="key">'Alt'</code>
					and
						<code class="key">'Control'</code>
					modifier keys.
					Implementations are encouraged to use the
						<code class="key">'AltGraph'</code>
					modifier key.
					</p>

				<p>The following example describes a possible sequence of events associated with the generation of the Unicode character Q (Latin Capital Letter Q, <a class="def"

					combining character before the corresponding letter. For example, the word <em>naïve</em>, using the combining diacritic <em>¨</em>, would be represented sequentially
					in Unicode as <em>nai¨ve</em>, but MAY be typed <em>na¨ive</em>.  The sequence of keystrokes <code class="char">'\u0302'</code> (Combining Circumflex Accent key) and <code class="char">'\u0065'</code>
					(key marked with the Latin Small Letter E) will likely produce (on a PC/AT french keyboard using a french mapping and without any modifier activated) the Unicode
					character <code class="glyph">'&#xEA;'</code> (Latin Small Letter E With Circumflex), as preferred by the Unicode Normalization Form <em>NFC</em>:</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>keydown</code> and <code>keyup</code> events shown in these
					examples would normally be suppressed during the composition session.
					They are included in these examples to make the user actions (pressing and releasing keys) more apparent.

				<h3>Input Method Editors</h3>

				<p>This specification includes a model for <a class="def" href="#glossary-ime">input method editors (IMEs)</a>, through the <a href="#interface-CompositionEvent">CompositionEvent</a>
					interface and events.  However, Composition Events and Keyboard Events do not necessarily map as a one-to-one relationship.  As an example, receiving a <a class="eventtype"
					href="#event-type-keydown"><code>keydown</code></a> for the <a href="#key-Accept"><code class="key">'Accept'</code></a> key value does not necessarily imply
					that the text currently selected in the <a class="def" href="#glossary-ime">IME</a> is being accepted, but indicates only that a keystroke happened, disconnected
					from the <a class="def" href="#glossary-ime">IME</a> Accept functionality (which would normally result in a <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-compositionend">
					<code>compositionend</code></a> event in most <a class="def" href="#glossary-ime">IME</a> systems).  Keyboard events cannot be used to determine the current
					state of the input method editor, which can be obtained through the <a href="#widl-CompositionEvent-data"><code>data</code></a> attribute of the <a href="#interface-CompositionEvent">
					CompositionEvent</a> interface.  Additionally, <a class="def" href="#glossary-ime">IME</a> systems and devices vary in their functionality, and in which keys
					are used for activating that functionality, such that the <code class="key">'Convert'</code> and <code class="key">'Accept'</code> keys MAY be represented
					by other available keys. Keyboard events correspond to the events generated by the input device after the keyboard layout mapping.</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>  In some implementations or system configurations, some key events, or their values, might be suppressed
					by the <a class="def" href="#glossary-ime">IME</a> in use.</p>

				<p>The following example describes a possible sequence of keys to generate the Unicode character <code class="glyph">'&#x5E02;'</code> (Kanji character, part of CJK Unified Ideographs) using Japanese
					input methods. This example assumes that the input method editor is activated and in the Japanese-Romaji input mode. The keys <code class="key">'Convert'</code>
					and <code class="key">'Accept'</code> MAY be replaced by others depending on the input device in use and the configuration of the IME, e.g., it can be respectively
					<code class="char">'\u0020'</code> (Space key) and <code class="key">'Enter'</code>.</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code class="glyph">'&#x8A69;'</code> (<q>poem</q>) and <code class="glyph">'&#x5E02;'</code> (<q>city</q>) are homophones, both
					pronounced し (<q>shi</q>), so the user needs to use the <code class="key">'Convert'</code> key to select the proper option.</p>

				<h3>Guidelines for selecting key values</h3>

				<p><strong>This section is normative.</strong></p>

				<p>To determine the appropriate key values for a key, the user agent needs to consider the current
					function of the key (i.e., with modifiers), taking into account the
					keyboard layout mapping in use, to determine if the key is represented by the set of defined key
					values, if a corresponding Unicode character exists from which a key value MAY be derived, or if
					a new key value MUST be defined.
					The following algorithm determines
					the <em>key value</em> and <em>character value</em> to use:</p>

				<ol class="algo" id="key-algorithm">
					<li>If the primary current function of the key is to generate a character, then:
						<ol class="algo">
							<li>If there exists an appropriate character in the <a href="#keys-keyvalues">key values set</a>,
								then the
									<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-key"><code>KeyboardEvent.key</code></a>
								attribute MUST be a string consisting of the <em>key value</em> of that character.
								</li>
							<li>If there is no appropriate key value in the <a href="#keys-keyvalues">key values set</a>,
								and there exists an appropriate
									<a class="def" href="#glossary-unicode-code-point">Unicode code point</a>,
								then the
									<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-key"><code>KeyboardEvent.key</code></a>
								attribute MUST be a string consisting of the <em>char value</em> of that character.
								</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>If the primary current function of the key is to serve as a function key, then:
						<ol class="algo">
							<li>If there exists an appropriate key value in the <a href="#keys-keyvalues">key values set</a>,
								then the
									<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-key"><code>KeyboardEvent.key</code></a>
								attribute MUST be a string consisting of the <em>key value</em> of that character.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="example-title"></div>
					<ul>
						<li>On a PC/AT US keyboard with a right-handed single-hand Dvorak
								<a class="def" href="#glossary-key-mapping">key mapping</a>,
							the key labeled
								<code class="key">'Q'</code>
							maps to the key values
								<code class="key">'5'</code> (unmodified)
							and
								<code class="key">'%'</code> (shifted).
							The primary function of this key is to generate the character
								<code class="key">'5'</code> (<code class="char">'\u0035'</code>).
							Since this character is a character (in Unicode general category
							<abbr title="Number, Decimal Digit">Nd</abbr>), the
								<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-key"><code>KeyboardEvent.key</code></a>
							attribute value for the unmodified key will be <code class="key">'5'</code>.
							</li>
						<li>On a French PC keyboard with a standard French mapping, the primary function of the
								<code class="key">'^'</code>
							key is as a
								<a class="def" href="#glossary-dead-key">dead key</a>
							for the circumflex diacritical mark.
							The Unicode value for this key is <code class="char">'\u0302'</code>.
							</li>
						<li>On a Korean PC keyboard with a standard Korean mapping, the primary function of the
								<code class="key">'Ha/En'</code>
							key is to switch between Hangul and English input.
							The predefined key value list has an appropriate entry for this key,
								<code class="key">'HangulMode'</code>,
							so this will be the key value.
							</li>
						<li>On some models of mobile devices, there are special keys to launch specific applications.
							For a standard application like Calendar, there is a predefined key value of
								<code class="key">'LaunchCalendar'</code>.
							For applications not listed in the key value list, a new value may need to be defined.
							</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>While every attempt has been made to make this list of key values as complete as possible, new key values
					will periodically need to be defined as new input devices are introduced.
					Rather than allowing user agents to define their own key values (which may not work across multiple user
					agents), bugs should be filed so that this specification can be updated.

	<!-- Appendix A: Legacy Event Initializers ========================================================-->
	<section id="legacy-event-initializers" class="appendix">
		<h1>Legacy Event Initializers</h1>

		<p><em>This section is informative</em></p>

		<p>Early versions of this specification included an initialization method on the
			interface (for example <code>initMouseEvent</code>) that required a long list of parameters
			that, in most cases, did not fully initialize all attributes of the event object.
			Because of this, event interfaces which were derived from the basic <code>Event</code> interface
			required that the initializer of <em>each</em> of the derived
			interfaces be called explicitly in order to fully initialize an event.
			</p>
			
		<div class="example">
			<div class="example-title"></div>
			<p>Initializing all the attributes of a MutationEvent requires calls to two initializer methods:
				<code>initEvent</code> and <code>initMutationEvent</code>.
				</p>
		</div>

		<p>Due in part to the length of time in the development of this standard, some implementations MAY have
			taken a dependency on these (now deprecated) initializer methods.
			For completeness, these legacy event intializers are described in this Appendix.

	<section id="legacy-key-attributes">
		<h1>Legacy Key Attributes</h1>
		<p><em>This section is informative</em></p>

		<p>This section provides a non-normative description of the attributes that are currently used when
			handling keyboard events.
			</p>

		<p>These features were never formally specified and the current browser implementations vary in
			significant ways.
			The large amount of legacy content, including script libraries, that relies upon detecting the
			<a class="def" href="#glossary-user-agent">user agent</a> and acting accordingly means that any
			attempt to formalize these legacy attributes and events would risk breaking as much content as
			it would fix or enable.
			Additionally, these attributes are not suitable for international usage, nor do they address
			accessibility concerns.
			</p>

		<p>Therefore, this specification does not normatively define the events and attributes commonly employed
			for handling keyboard input, though they MAY be present in
			<a class="def" href="#glossary-user-agent">user agents</a> for compatibility with legacy content.
			Authors SHOULD use the <a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-key"><code>KeyboardEvent.key</code></a> attribute
			instead of the <code class="attribute-name">charCode</code>
			and <code class="attribute-name">keyCode</code> attributes.
			</p>

		<p>However, for the purpose of documenting the current state of these features and their relation to
			normative events and attributes, this section provides an informative description.
			For implementations which do support these attributes and events, it is suggested that the definitions
			provided in this section be used.

			<h2>Legacy <a href="#interface-KeyboardEvent"><code>KeyboardEvent</code></a> supplemental interface</h2>
			<p><em>This section is informative</em></p>
			
			<p>Browser support for keyboards has traditionally relied on three ad-hoc attributes,
				<code class="attribute-name">keyCode</code>, <code class="attribute-name">charCode</code>,
				and <code class="attribute-name">which</code>.</p>

			<p>All three of these attributes return a numerical code that represents some aspect of the key pressed:
				<code class="attribute-name">keyCode</code> is an index of the key itself.
				<code class="attribute-name">charCode</code> is the ASCII value of the character keys.
				<code class="attribute-name">which</code> is the character value where available and otherwise the key index.
				The values for these attributes, and the availability of the attribute, is inconsistent across
				platforms, keyboard languages and layouts, <a class="def" href="#glossary-user-agent">user agents</a>,
				versions, and even event types.

			<h3>Legacy <a href="#interface-MutationEvent"><code>MutationEvent</code></a> events</h3>

			<p>The mutation and mutation name event modules are designed to allow notification of any
				changes to the structure of a document, including attribute, text, or name modifications.
				</p>

			<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
				None of the event types associated with the <code>MutationEvent</code> interface are
				designated as cancelable.
				This stems from the fact that it is very difficult to make use of existing DOM interfaces
				which cause document modifications if any change to the document might or might not take
				place due to cancelation of the resulting event.
				Although this is still a desired capability, it was decided that it would be better left
				until the addition of transactions into the DOM.
				</p>

			<p>Many single modifications of the tree can cause multiple mutation events to be dispatched.
				Rather than attempt to specify the ordering of mutation events due to every possible
				modification of the tree, the ordering of these events is left to the implementation.

				<p><strong>Warning!</strong></p>
				<p>The <a href="#interface-MutationEvent">MutationEvent interface</a> was introduced in
					DOM Level 2 Events, but has not yet been completely and interoperably implemented across

					In addition, there have been critiques that the interface, as designed, introduces a
					performance and implementation challenge.
					</p>
				<p>DOM4 [<a href="#references-DOM4">DOM4</a>] provides a new mechanism using a
					<code>MutationObserver</code> interface which addresses the use cases that mutation events
					solve, but in a more performant manner.
					Thus, this specification describes mutation events for reference and completeness of legacy

		<h1>Extending Events</h1>
		<p><em>This section is informative</em></p>

		<section id="extending-events-intro">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
			<p>This specification defines several interfaces and many events, however, this is not
				an exhaustive set of events for all purposes.
				To allow content authors and implementers to add desired functionality, this specification
				provides two mechanisms for extend this set of interfaces and events without creating conflicts:
					<a href="#extending-events-Custom_Events">custom events</a>
				and <a href="#extending-events-Impl_Extensions">implementation-specific extensions</a>.
				</p>
		</section>  <!-- extending-events-intro -->

		<section id="extending-events-Custom_Events">
			<h2>Custom Events</h2>
			
			<p>A script author MAY wish to define an application in terms of functional components, with event
				types that are meaningful to the application architecture.
				The content author can use the <a href="#interface-CustomEvent"><code>CustomEvent</code></a> interface
				to create their own events appropriate to the level of abstraction they are using.
				</p>

			<div class="example">
				<div class="example-title"></div>
				<p>A content author might have created an application which features a dynamically generated bar chart.
					This bar chart is meant to be updated every 5 minutes, or when a feed shows new information, or
					when the user refreshes it manually by clicking a button.
					There are several handlers that have to be called when the chart needs to be updated:
					the application has to fetch the most recent data, show an icon to the user that the event is being
					updated, and rebuild the chart.
					To manage this, the content author can choose to create a custom <q>updateChart</q> event,
					which is fired whenever one of the trigger conditions is met:
					</p>
<pre><code>
var chartData = ...;
var evt = document.createEvent("CustomEvent");
evt.initCustomEvent( "updateChart", true, false, { data: chartData });
document.documentElement.dispatchEvent(evt);
</code></pre>
			</div>
		</section>  <!-- extending-events-Custom_Events -->

		<section id="extending-events-Impl_Extensions">
			<h2>Implementation-Specific Extensions</h2>
			
			<p>While a new event is being designed and prototyped, or when an event is intended for implementation-specific
				functionality, it is desirable to distinguish it from standardized events.
				Implementors SHOULD prefix event types specific to their implementations with a short string to distinguish
				it from the same event in other implementations and from standardized events.
				This is similar to the
					<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords" title="CSS 2.1: Syntax and basic data types">vendor-specific keyword prefixes</a>
				in CSS, though without the dashes (<code>"-"</code>) used in CSS, since that can cause problems when used
				as an attribute name in Javascript.
				</p>

			<div class="example">
				<div class="example-title"></div>
				<p>A particular browser vendor, <q>FooCorp</q>, might wish to introduce a new event, <code class="eventtype">jump</code>.
					This vendor implements <code class="eventtype">fooJump</code> in their browser, using their
					vendor-specific prefix: <code>'foo'</code>.
					Early adopters start experimenting with the event, using
						<code>someElement.addEventListener("fooJump", doJump, false )</code>,
					and provide feedback to FooCorp, who change the behavior of <code class="eventtype">fooJump</code> accordingly.
					</p>

				<p>After some time, another vendor, <q>BarOrg</q>, decides they also want the functionality, but implement
					it slightly differently, so they use their own vendor-specific prefix, <code>"bar"</code> in their
					event type name: <code class="eventtype">barJump</code>.
					Content authors experimenting with this version of the <code class="eventtype">jump</code> event type
					register events with BarOrg's event type name.
					Content authors who wish to write code that accounts for both browsers can either register each event type
					separately with specific handlers, or use the same handler and switch on the name of the event type.
					Thus, early experiments in different codebases do not conflict, and the early adopter is able to write
					easily-maintained code for multiple implementations.
					</p>

				<p>Eventually, as the feature matures, the behavior of both browsers stabilizes and might converge due to
					content author and user feedback or through formal standardization.
					As this stabilization occurs, and risk of conflicts decrease, content authors can remove the forked code,
					and use the <code class="eventtype">jump</code> event type name (even before it is formally standardized)
					using the same event handler and the more generic registration method
						<code>someElement.addEventListener( "jump", doJump, false)</code>.
					</p>
			</div>

	<!-- Appendix E: Security Considerations ========================================================-->
	<section id="security-considerations">
		<h1>Security Considerations</h1>

		<p>This appendix discusses security considerations for DOM Level 3 Events implementations.
			The discussion is limited to security issues that arise directly from implementation of the event
			model, APIs and events defined in this specification.
			Implementations typically support other features like scripting languages, other APIs and
			additional events not defined in this document.
			These features constitute an unknown factor and are out of scope of this document.
			Implementers SHOULD consult the specifications of such features for their respective
			security considerations.
			</p>

		<p>Many of the event types defined in this specification are dispatched in response to user actions.
			This allows malicious event listeners to gain access to information users would typically consider
			confidential, e.g., typos they might have made when filling out a form, if they reconsider their
			answer to a multiple choice question shortly before submitting a form, their typing rate or primary
			input mechanism.
			In the worst case, malicious event listeners could capture all user interactions and submit them
			to a third party through means (not defined in DOM Level 3 Events) that are generally available
			in DOM implementations, such as the XMLHttpRequest interface.
			</p>

		<p>In DOM implementations that support facilities to load external data, events like the
			<a class="eventtype"><code>error</code></a> event can provide access to sensitive information about
			the environment of the computer system or network.
			An example would be a malicious HTML document that attempts to embed a resource on the local network
			or the localhost on different ports.
			An embedded <a class="def" href="#glossary-DOM-application">DOM application</a> could then listen
			for <a class="eventtype"><code>error</code></a> and <a class="eventtype"><code>load</code></a> events
			to determine which other computers in a network are accessible from the local system or which ports
			are open on the system to prepare further attacks.
			</p>

		<p>An implementation of DOM Level 3 Events alone is generally insufficient to perform attacks of this kind
			and the security considerations of the facilities that possibly support such attacks apply.
			For conformance with this specification, DOM implementations MAY take reasonable steps to ensure that
			<a class="def" href="#glossary-DOM-application">DOM applications</a> do not get access to confidential
			or sensitive information.
			For example, they might choose not to dispatch <a class="eventtype"><code>load</code></a> events to
			nodes that attempt to embed resources on the local network.

		<section id="changes-drafts">
			<h2>Changes between different drafts of DOM Level 3 Events</h2>

			<p>The DOM Level 3 Events document was originally developed between 2000 and 2003, and published
				as a W3C Note, pending further feedback and interest from implementers.
				In 2006, it was picked up for revision and progress on the Recommendation Track, and was
				then revised to reflect the current state of implementation and the
				needs of script authors.
				</p>

			<p>Despite its status only as a W3C Note, rather than an official Recommendation, DOM 3 Events
				saw some implementation, and was also referenced by other specifications, so care
				is being taken to cause minimal disruption, while still adapting the specification to the
				current environment.
				</p>

			<p>The current specification has been reordered significantly from the earlier W3C Note form,
				and also from the structure of DOM2 Events, in order to clarify the material.
				New diagrams have been put in place to represent hierarchies and events flows more clearly.
				Here are some of the more important changes between drafts:
				</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The <q>key identifier</q> feature has been renamed <q>key value</q> to disambiguate
					them from unique identifiers for keys.
					</li>
				<li>The
						<a href="#interface-KeyboardEvent"><code>KeyboardEvent</code></a>
					interface was briefly (from 2003-2010) defined to have <code>keyIdentifier</code>
					and <code>keyLocation</code> attributes, but these were removed in favor of the current
						<a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-key"><code>key</code></a>
						and <a href="#widl-KeyboardEvent-location"><code>location</code></a>
					attributes. These attributes were not widely implemented.
					</li>
				<li>The <a href="#interface-KeyboardEvent"><code>KeyboardEvent</code></a> also had a <code>char</code>
					attribute that was only used by the
						<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-keypress"><code>keypress</code></a>
					event. Since the keypress event has been deprecated, this attribute was no longer useful
					and was removed.
					</li>
				<li>The <code>change</code>, <code>submit</code>, and <code>reset</code> events were removed,
					since they were specific to HTML forms, and are specified in
					[<cite><a class="informative" href="#references-HTML5">HTML5</a></cite>].
					</li>
				<li>The <code>textInput</code> event, originally proposed as a replacement for
					<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-keypress"><code>keypress</code></a>, was
					removed in favor of the current
						<a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-beforeinput"><code>beforeinput</code></a>
					and <a class="eventtype" href="#event-type-input"><code>input</code></a> events.
					</li>
				<li>Namespaced events have been removed.
					</li>
				<li>Updated to use <a href="#references-WebIDL">Web IDL</a>.
					</li>
				<li>EventException has been removed.
