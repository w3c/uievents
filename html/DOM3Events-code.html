		<h1>Keyboard Layout</h1>
		<p><em>This section is informative</em></p>

		<p>Alphanumeric keyboards are the most common way for users to generate keyboard events.
			This section provides an overview of standard keyboards and their physical layouts.
			</p>

		<section id="keyboard-common-layouts">
			<h1>Standard Keyboard Layouts</h1>

			<p>This section describes the physical layouts found on commonly available keyboards.
				</p>

			<section id="keyboard-sections">
				<h1>Keyboard Sections</h1>
			
				<p>When discussing keyboard layouts, it is convenient to divide the standard keyboard into distinct sections
					and to label each row.
					</p>

				<figure id="figure-keyboard-sections">
					<img src='images/keyboard-sections.svg' width="684" height="225" />
					<figcaption>The five general sections of a standard keyboard</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>These keyboard sections are:
					</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The <em>Alphanumeric</em> section is the main part of the keyboard and is where most of the keyboard variation occurs.
						When a user selects a keyboard layout, it is the keys in this sections that are most affected.
						</li>
					<li>The <em>Control Pad</em> and <em>Arrow Pad</em> sections contain the arrow keys and other editing keys.
						</li>
					<li>The <em>Numpad</em> (also known as the "numeric keypad" or "number pad") contains number and math keys to make it 
						easier to enter numeric data.
						</li>
					<li>And finally, the <em>Function</em> section contains miscellaneous function keys and special keys like Escape.
						</li>
				</ul>
			
				<p>To make it easier to identify keys, the rows on the keyboard are named starting with "A"
					for the bottom row up to "E" for the top row. The row of keys in the Function section are considered
					to be in row "K".
					These row names are consistent with those given in the ISO/IEC 9995-1 specification.
					</p>
				<p>Note that many keyboards (both modern and legacy) have extra keys that do not fit neatly into the above sections.
					Some of these keys are covered in the <a href="#key-media">Media Keys</a> section.
					Keys not covered in this document should be handled in the same manner as described in the
					<a href="#other-devices">Other Devices</a> section.

				<h1>Standard "101" Keyboard Layout</h1>
				<p>The standard "101" keyboard (commonly referred to as the "US layout") is the only layout that uses the <code class="key-code">'Backslash'</code> code.
				   All the other layouts omit this key and expand the <code class="key-code">'Enter'</code> key to occupy
				   two-rows.

				<p>Modern standard "101"-layout keyboards actually contain 104 keys: 61 keys in the alphanumeric section
				   and 43 keys in the numpad, control pad, arrow pad and function sections.
				   The "101" name for this keyboard layout dates to the time when this standard keyboard did in fact contain
				   101 keys. The two <code class="glyph">'OS'</code> keys,
				   and the <code class="glyph">'Menu'</code> key were
				   added later to bring the total to 104 keys.

			<section id="keyboard-101alt">
				<h1>Alternate "101" Keyboard Layout</h1>
				<p>The alternate "101" keyboard removes the <code class="key-code">'Backslash'</code> key to create a
				   large <code class="key-code">'Enter'</code> key and shrinks the <code class="key-code">'Backspace'</code>
				   key to make room for the <code class="key-code">'IntlYen'</code> key (The <code class="key-code">'IntlYen'</code> name comes from the
				   Japanese layout — in the Russian layout shown above this key maps to a <code class="glyph">'\'</code>.

			<section id="keyboard-102">
				<h1>Standard "102" Keyboard Layout</h1>
				<p>The standard "102" keyboard is common throughout Europe and adds two keys that don't exist on the

				   and the <code class="key-code">'IntlHash'</code> key which is partially tucked under the

				   plus the <code class="key-code">'IntlRo'</code> key (next to the right shift

			<h4>Mobile Keypads</h4>

			<p>In the case where a content author wishes to rely on the mechanical layout of a mobile keypad, this specification suggests the keyboard configuration specified
				in ISO/IEC 9995-8:2006 [<cite><a class="informative" href="#references-ISO-9995-8">ISO-9995-8</a></cite>], which defines a numeric keypad layout and secondary assignment
				of Unicode characters in the range <code class="char">'\u0061'</code>..<code class="char">'\u007A'</code> to the number keys <code>2</code> through <code>9</code>, as a common layout appropriate to some
				international uses.</p>

			<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This keypad layout, and in particular the distribution of letters is for English devices, and will not match the keypads
				or configurations of many users.  Content authors cannot rely upon any particular configuration, and are expected to create content in an internationalized and
				localizable manner.</p>

		<section id="remote-control">
			<h4>Media Remote Controls</h4>

			<p>Many keyboards contain special keys to control media functions.  Increasingly, many media devices, especially televisions, are Web-enabled.  Hybrid keyboard/remote-control
				devices are becoming more common.  To meet the needs of these hybrid Web/media devices, this specification defines keys that are common as remote control buttons,
				in addition to traditional keyboard keys.</p>

			<p>Because of the smaller form factor, keys (or buttons) on a remote control will often be modal,
				with one key performing different functions based on the context of the on-screen content.
				Additionally, many keys serve as toggles, to change back and forth between two or more states
				(see toggling keys).
				These remote control buttons typically do not have modifier states so each button is assigned a
				single function (like "Play", "Pause", "Up", "Menu" or "Exit").
				</p>

		<section id="keyboard-chording-virtual">
			<h4>Virtual Keyboards and Chording Keyboards</h4>

			<p>Virtual keyboards are software-based sets of keys, in a variety of different arrangements, commonly found on touch-screen devices. They are often modal, with the
				ability to switch between different dynamic sets of keys, such as alphabetic, numeric, or symbolic keys.  Because of the lack of physical constraints, these keyboards
				MAY present the widest range of characters, including emoticons and other symbols, and MAY have keys not represented by Unicode [<a href="#references-Unicode">Unicode</a>]
				or by the <a href="#key-value-tables">key values</a> defined in this specification.  Wherever possible, however, virtual keyboards SHOULD produce the normal range
				of keyboard events and values, for ease of authoring and compatibility with existing content.</p>

			<p>Chording keyboards, also know as chorded keysets or chord keyboards, are key input devices which produce values by pressing several keys in combination or sequence,
				normally to simulate a full range of characters or commands on a reduced set of keys, often for single-handed use.  A chording keyboard MAY have additional mode
				keys to switch between key values, and the number and type of keys pressed to produce a key value will vary, but the final key values produced by such keyboards
				SHOULD match the range of key values described in this specification.</p>

			<p>For these and other alternative modal keyboards, the key values <a href="#key-Alphanumeric"><code class="key">'Alphanumeric'</code></a>, <a href="#key-CapsLock">
				<code class="key">'CapsLock'</code></a>, <a href="#key-NumLock"><code class="key">'NumLock'</code></a>, and <a href="#key-SymbolLock"><code class="key">
				'SymbolLock'</code></a> are RECOMMENDED for the keys which switch between different modes.</p>
