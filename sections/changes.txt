<h3 id="changes-DOMEvents2to3Changes">Changes between DOM Level 2 Events and UI Events</h3>

    Numerous clarifications to the interfaces and event types have been made.
    The <code>HTMLEvents</code> module is no longer defined in this document.
    The EVENT{focus} and EVENT{blur} events have been added to the {{UIEvent}}
    module, and the EVENT{dblclick} event has been added to the {{MouseEvent}}
    module. This new specification provides a better separation between the DOM
    event flow, the event types, and the DOM interfaces.

    <h4 id="changes-DOMEvents2to3Changes-flow">Changes to DOM Level 2 event flow</h4>

        This new specification introduced the following new concepts in the
        event flow:

        *	<a>Event listeners</a> are now ordered. In DOM Level 2, the event ordering
        	was unspecified.
        *	The event flow now includes the <a><code>Window</code></a>, to
            reflect existing implementations.

	<h4 id="changes-DOMEvents2to3Changes-event-types">Changes to DOM Level 2 event types</h4>

		Many clarifications have been made on the event types. The conformance
		is now explicitly defined against the event types, and not only in terms
		of interfaces used by the event types.

		<code>"MutationEvents"</code> have been deprecated. Support for
		namespaced events, present in early drafts of this specification, has
		also been removed.

		For user agents which support the EVENT{DOMNodeInserted} and
		EVENT{DOMNodeRemoved} event types, this specification no longer requires
		that the event type be fired for <code>Attr</code> nodes.

		The <code>resize</code> event type no longer bubbles and the EVENT{mousemove}
		event is now cancelable, reflecting existing implementations.

	<h4 id="changes-DOMLevel2to3Changes">Changes to DOM Level 2 Events interfaces</h4>

		<dl>
			<dt>Interface {{Event}}</dt>
			<dd>
				*	The {{Event}} interface has one new attribute,
					{{Event/defaultPrevented}}, and one new method,
					{{Event/stopImmediatePropagation()}}.
				*	{{Event/timeStamp}} is now a <code>Number</code> in the
					ECMAScript binding. A proposed correction to make the same
					change in [[DOM-Level-3-Core]] is forthcoming.
				*	This specification considers the {{Event/type}} attribute
					to be case-sensitive, while DOM Level 2 Events considers
					{{Event/type}} to be case-insensitive.
			</dd>

			<dt>Interface {{EventTarget}}</dt>
			<dd>
				*	The method {{EventTarget/dispatchEvent()}} was modified.
			</dd>

			<dt>Interface {{MouseEvent}}</dt>
			<dd>
				*	The {{MouseEvent}} interface has one new method {{MouseEvent/getModifierState()}}.
			</dd>

			<dt>Exception <code>EventException</code></dt>
			<dd>
				*	The exception <code>EventException</code> is removed in this
					specification. The prior <code>DISPATCH_REQUEST_ERR</code>
					code is re-mapped to a <code>DOMException</code> of type
					<code>InvalidStateError</code>.
			</dd>
		</dl>

	<h4 id="changes-DOMLevel3Addons">New Interfaces</h4>

		The interfaces {{CustomEvent}}, {{FocusEvent}}, {{KeyboardEvent}},
		{{CompositionEvent}}, and {{WheelEvent}} were added to the Events module.

<h3 id="changes-drafts">Changes between different drafts of UI Events</h3>

	The DOM Level 3 Events document was originally developed between 2000 and
	2003, and published as a W3C Note, pending further feedback and interest
	from implementers. In 2006, it was picked up for revision and progress on
	the Recommendation Track, and was then revised to reflect the current state
	of implementation and the needs of script authors.

	Despite its status only as a W3C Note, rather than an official
	Recommendation, DOM 3 Events saw some implementation, and was also
	referenced by other specifications, so care is being taken to cause minimal
	disruption, while still adapting the specification to the current
	environment.

	The current specification has been reordered significantly from the earlier
	W3C Note form, and also from the structure of DOM2 Events, in order to
	clarify the material. New diagrams have been put in place to represent
	hierarchies and events flows more clearly. Here are some of the more
	important changes between drafts:

	*	The <q>key identifier</q> feature has been renamed <q>key value</q> to
		disambiguate them from unique identifiers for keys.

	*	The {{KeyboardEvent}} interface was briefly (from 2003-2010) defined to
		have <code>keyIdentifier</code> and <code>keyLocation</code> attributes,
		but these were removed in favor of the current {{KeyboardEvent/key}} and
		{{KeyboardEvent/location}} attributes. These attributes were not widely
		implemented.

	*	The {{KeyboardEvent}} and {{CompositionEvent}} interfaces defined a
		<code>locale</code> attribute. This attribute was underspecified and
		moved into a technical note until it can be specified adequately.
		Refer to this
		<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-uievents-20140612/">old version of UI Events</a>
		(before the DOM3Events spec was renamed "UI Events") for details.

	*	The {{KeyboardEvent}} also had a <code>char</code> attribute that
		was only used by the EVENT{keypress} event. Since the keypress event has
		been deprecated, this attribute was no longer useful and was removed.

	*	The <code>change</code>, <code>submit</code>, and <code>reset</code>
		events were removed, since they were specific to HTML forms, and are
		specified in [[HTML5]].

	*	The <code>textInput</code> event, originally proposed as a replacement
		for EVENT{keypress}, was removed in favor of the current
		EVENT{beforeinput} and EVENT{input} events.

	*	Namespaced events have been removed.

	*	Updated to use [[WebIDL]].

	*	EventException has been removed.
