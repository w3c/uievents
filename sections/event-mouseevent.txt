<h3 id="events-mouseevents">Mouse Events</h3>

	The mouse event module originates from the [[HTML401]] <code>onclick</code>,
	<code>ondblclick</code>, <code>onmousedown</code>, <code>onmouseup</code>,
	<code>onmouseover</code>, <code>onmousemove</code>, and
	<code>onmouseout</code> attributes. This event module is specifically
	designed for use with pointing input devices, such as a mouse or a trackball.

	<h4 id="interface-mouseevent">Interface MouseEvent</h4>

		<p class="intro-dom">Introduced in DOM Level 2, modified in this
		specification
		</p>

		The {{MouseEvent}} interface provides specific contextual information
		associated with Mouse events.

		In the case of nested elements, mouse events are always targeted at the
		most deeply nested element.

		<p class="note">
		Ancestors of the targeted element can use event bubbling to obtain
		notifications of mouse events which occur within their descendent
		elements.
		</p>

		To create an instance of the {{MouseEvent}} interface, use the
		{{MouseEvent}} constructor, passing an optional {{MouseEventInit}}
		dictionary.

		<p class="note">
		When initializing {{MouseEvent}} objects using <code>initMouseEvent</code>,
		implementations can use the client coordinates {{MouseEvent/clientX}}
		and {{MouseEvent/clientY}} for calculation of other coordinates (such
		as target coordinates exposed by <a>DOM Level 0</a> implementations or
		other proprietary attributes, e.g., <code>pageX</code>).

					During any mouse events, {{MouseEvent/buttons}} MUST be used to

					<p class="note">
					Though similarly named, the values for the
					{{MouseEvent/buttons}} attribute and the {{MouseEvent/button}}
					attribute are very different. The value of {{MouseEvent/button}}
					is assumed to be valid during EVENT{mousedown} / EVENT{mouseup}
					event handlers, whereas the {{MouseEvent/buttons}} attribute
					reflects the state of the mouse's buttons for any trusted
					{{MouseEvent}} object (while it is being dispatched), because it
					can represent the "no button currently active" state (0).

					The value of the {{MouseEvent/buttons}}
					attribute MUST be as follows:

					*	<code>0</code> MUST indicate no button is currently active.
					*	<code>1</code> MUST indicate the primary button of the device
						(in general, the left button or the only button on single-button devices,
						used to activate a user interface control or select text).
					*	<code>2</code> MUST indicate the secondary button
						(in general, the right button, often used to display a context menu), if present.
					*	<code>4</code> MUST indicate the auxiliary button
						(in general, the middle button, often combined with a mouse wheel).

					Some pointing devices provide or simulate more buttons. To
					represent such buttons, the value MUST be doubled for each
					successive button (in the binary series <code>8</code>,
					<code>16</code>, <code>32</code>, ... ).

					<p class="note">
					Because the sum of any set of button values is a unique number,
					a content author can use a bitwise operation to determine how
					many buttons are currently being pressed and which buttons they
					are, for an arbitrary number of mouse buttons on a device. For
					example, the value <code>3</code> indicates that the left and
					right button are currently both pressed, while the value
					<code>5</code> indicates that the left and middle button are
					currently both pressed.

		<h5 id="mouseevent-native-requirements">Native OS Requirements</h5>

			The algorithms in this section assume that the native platform OS will
			provide the following:

			* An event when the mouse is moved (handled by <a>handle native mouse move</a>)
			* An event when a mouse button is pressed (handled by <a>handle native mouse down</a>)
			* An event when a mouse button is released (handled by <a>handle native mouse up</a>)
			* A way to identify when a mouse button press should be interpreted as a "click"
				(handled by <a>handle native mouse click</a>)
				* For example, as a flag or as a separate event
				* If a separate "click" event is fired, then the native OS will fire it
					immediately after the corresponding "mouse up" event, with no
					intervening mouse-related events
			* A way to identify when a mouse click is a "double click" (handled by
				<a>handle native mouse double click</a>)

			For these events, the OS will be able to provide the following info:

			* The x,y mouse coordinates relative to the native OS desktop
			* The x,y mouse coordinates relative to the UA's window viewport
			* Which keyboard modifiers are currently being held

		<h5 id="mouseevent-global-state">Global State for MouseEvent</h5>

	<h4 id="events-mouseevent-event-order">Mouse Event Order</h4>

		Certain mouse events defined in this specification MUST occur in a set
		order relative to one another. The following shows the event sequence
		that MUST occur when a pointing device's cursor is moved over an element:

		++---+------------+---------+------------------------------------------+
		=| # | Event Type | Element | Notes                                    |

		When a pointing device is moved into an element <em>A</em>, and then
		into a nested element <em>B</em> and then back out again, the following
		sequence of events MUST occur:

		++----+------------+---------+-----------------------------------------+
		=|  # | Event Type | Element | Notes                                   |

		Sometimes elements can be visually overlapped using CSS. In the
		following example, three elements labeled A, B, and C all have the same
		dimensions and absolute position on a web page. Element C is a child of
		B, and B is a child of A in the DOM:

		<figure id="figure-mouse-event-stacked-elements">
			<img src='images/stacked-event-mouse-dispatch.svg' height="250" alt="Graphical representation of three stacked elements all on top of each other. The bottom element is labeled A and the top element is C">
			<figcaption>Graphical representation of three stacked elements all on top of each other, with the pointing device moving over the stack.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		When the pointing device is moved from outside the element stack to the
		element labeled C and then moved out again, the following series of
		events MUST occur:

		++----+------------+---------+-----------------------------------------+
		=|  # | Event Type | Element | Notes                                   |

		<p class="note">
		The EVENT{mouseover}/EVENT{mouseout} events are only fired once, while
		EVENT{mouseenter}/EVENT{mouseleave} events are fired three times (once

		The following is the typical sequence of events when a button associated
		with a pointing device (e.g., a mouse button or trackpad) is pressed and
		released over an element:

		++----+------------+---------------------------------------------------+
		=|  # | Event Type | Notes                                             |

		++----+------------+---------------------------------------------------+

		<p class="note">
		The lag time, degree, distance, and number of EVENT{mousemove} events
		allowed between the EVENT{mousedown} and EVENT{mouseup} events while
		still firing a EVENT{click} or EVENT{dblclick} event will be
		implementation-, device-, and platform-specific. This tolerance can aid
		users that have physical disabilities like unsteady hands when these
		users interact with a pointing device.
		</p>

		Each implementation will determine the appropriate <a>hysteresis</a>
		tolerance, but in general SHOULD fire EVENT{click} and EVENT{dblclick}
		events when the event target of the associated EVENT{mousedown} and
		EVENT{mouseup} events is the same element with no EVENT{mouseout} or
		EVENT{mouseleave} events intervening, and SHOULD fire EVENT{click} and
		EVENT{dblclick} events on the nearest common inclusive ancestor when the
		associated EVENT{mousedown} and EVENT{mouseup} event targets are
		different.

		<p class="example">
		If a EVENT{mousedown} event was targeted at an HTML document's <a>body
		element</a>, and the corresponding EVENT{mouseup} event was targeted at
		the <a>root element</a>, then the EVENT{click} event will be dispatched
		to the <a>root element</a>, since it is the nearest common inclusive
		ancestor.
		</p>

		If the <a>event target</a> (e.g. the target element) is removed from the
		DOM during the mouse events sequence, the remaining events of the
		sequence MUST NOT be fired on that element.

		<p class="example">
		If the target element is removed from the DOM as the result of a
		EVENT{mousedown} event, no events for that element will be dispatched
		for EVENT{mouseup}, EVENT{click}, or EVENT{dblclick}, nor any default
		activation events. However, the EVENT{mouseup} event will still be
		dispatched on the element that is exposed to the mouse after the removal
		of the initial target element. Similarly, if the target element is
		removed from the DOM during the dispatch of a EVENT{mouseup} event, the
		EVENT{click} and subsequent events will not be dispatched.
		</p>

	<h4 id="events-mouse-types">Mouse Event Types</h4>

		The Mouse event types are listed below. In the case of nested elements,
		mouse event types are always targeted at the most deeply nested element.

			The EVENT{auxclick} event type MUST be dispatched on the <a>topmost
			event target</a> indicated by the pointer, when the user presses
			down and releases the non-primary pointer button, or otherwise activates
			the pointer in a manner that simulates such an action. The actuation
			method of the mouse button depends upon the pointer device and the
			environment configuration, e.g., it MAY depend on the screen
			location or the delay between the press and release of the pointing
			device button.

			The EVENT{auxclick} event should only be fired for the non-primary pointer
			buttons (i.e., when {{MouseEvent/button}} value is not <code>0</code>,
			{{MouseEvent/buttons}} value is greater than <code>1</code>). The primary button
			(like the left button on a standard mouse) MUST NOT fire
			EVENT{auxclick} events. See EVENT{click} for a corresponding event that
			is associated with the primary button.

			The EVENT{auxclick} event MAY be preceded by the EVENT{mousedown} and
			EVENT{mouseup} events on the same element, disregarding changes
			between other node types (e.g., text nodes).  Depending upon the
			environment configuration, the EVENT{auxclick} event MAY be dispatched
			if one or more of the event types EVENT{mouseover},
			EVENT{mousemove}, and EVENT{mouseout} occur between the press and
			release of the pointing device button.

			The <a>default action</a> of the EVENT{auxclick} event type varies
			based on the <a>event target</a> of the event and the value of the
			{{MouseEvent/button}} or {{MouseEvent/buttons}} attributes. Typical
			<a>default actions</a> of the EVENT{auxclick} event type are as follows:

			*	If the <a>event target</a> has associated activation behavior,
				the <a>default action</a> MUST be to execute that activation
				behavior (see [[#event-flow-activation]]).

			<p class="example">
			Receiving and handling auxclick for the middle button.<br>
<code class="pre">myLink.addEventListener("auxclick", function(e) {
  if (e.button === 1) {
    // This would prevent the default behavior which is for example
    // opening a new tab when middle clicking on a link.
    e.preventDefault();
    // Do something else to handle middle button click like taking
    // care of opening link or non-link buttons in new tabs in a way
    // that fits the app. Other actions like closing a tab in a tab-strip
    // which should be done on the click action can be done here too.
  }
});
</code>
			</p>

			<p class="note">
			In the case of right button, the EVENT{auxclick} event is dispatched after
			any EVENT{contextmenu} event. Note that some user agents swallow all input
			events while a context menu is being displayed, so auxclick may not be
			available to applications in such scenarios.
			See <a href="#example-auxclick-right">this example</a> for more clarification.
			</p>

			<p id="example-auxclick-right" class="example">
			Receiving and handling auxclick for the right button<br>
<code class="pre">myDiv.addEventListener("contextmenu", function(e) {
  // This call makes sure no context menu is shown
  // to interfere with page receiving the events.
  e.preventDefault();
});
myDiv.addEventListener("auxclick", function(e) {
  if (e.button === 2) {
    // Do something else to handle right button click like opening a
    // customized context menu inside the app.
  }
});

			The EVENT{click} event type MUST be dispatched on the <a>topmost
			event target</a> indicated by the pointer, when the user presses
			down and releases the primary pointer button, or otherwise activates
			the pointer in a manner that simulates such an action. The actuation
			method of the mouse button depends upon the pointer device and the
			environment configuration, e.g., it MAY depend on the screen
			location or the delay between the press and release of the pointing
			device button.

			The EVENT{click} event should only be fired for the primary pointer
			button (i.e., when {{MouseEvent/button}} value is <code>0</code>,
			{{MouseEvent/buttons}} value is <code>1</code>). Secondary buttons
			(like the middle or right button on a standard mouse) MUST NOT fire
			EVENT{click} events. See EVENT{auxclick} for a corresponding event that
			is associated with the non-primary buttons.

			The EVENT{click} event MAY be preceded by the EVENT{mousedown} and
			EVENT{mouseup} events on the same element, disregarding changes
			between other node types (e.g., text nodes).  Depending upon the
			environment configuration, the EVENT{click} event MAY be dispatched
			if one or more of the event types EVENT{mouseover},
			EVENT{mousemove}, and EVENT{mouseout} occur between the press and
			release of the pointing device button.  The EVENT{click} event MAY
			also be followed by the EVENT{dblclick} event.

			<p class="example">
			If a user mouses down on a text node child of a
			<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element which has been styled with a large
			line-height, shifts the mouse slightly such that it is no longer
			over an area containing text but is still within the containing
			block of that <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element (i.e., the pointer is
			between lines of the same text block, but not over the text node per
			se), then subsequently mouses up, this will likely still trigger a
			EVENT{click} event (if it falls within the normal temporal
			<a>hysteresis</a> for a EVENT{click}), since the user has stayed
			within the scope of the same element. Note that user-agent-generated
			mouse events are not dispatched on text nodes.
			</p>

			In addition to being associated with pointer devices, the
			EVENT{click} event type MUST be dispatched as part of an element
			activation, as described in [[#event-flow-activation]].

			<p class="note">
			For maximum accessibility, content authors are encouraged to use the
			EVENT{click} event type when defining activation behavior for custom
			controls, rather than other pointing-device event types such as
			EVENT{mousedown} or EVENT{mouseup}, which are more device-specific.
			Though the EVENT{click} event type has its origins in pointer
			devices (e.g., a mouse), subsequent implementation enhancements have
			extended it beyond that association, and it can be considered a
			device-independent event type for element activation.
			</p>

			The <a>default action</a> of the EVENT{click} event type varies
			based on the <a>event target</a> of the event and the value of the
			{{MouseEvent/button}} or {{MouseEvent/buttons}} attributes. Typical
			<a>default actions</a> of the EVENT{click} event type are as follows:

			*	If the <a>event target</a> has associated activation behavior,
				the <a>default action</a> MUST be to execute that activation

			*	If the <a>event target</a> is focusable, the <a>default
				action</a> MUST be to give that element document focus.

			A <a>user agent</a> MUST dispatch this event when the primary button
			of a pointing device is clicked twice over an element. The
			definition of a double click depends on the environment
			configuration, except that the event target MUST be the same between
			EVENT{mousedown}, EVENT{mouseup}, and EVENT{dblclick}. This event
			type MUST be dispatched after the event type EVENT{click} if a click
			and double click occur simultaneously, and after the event type
			EVENT{mouseup} otherwise.

			As with the EVENT{click} event, the EVENT{dblclick} event should
			only be fired for the primary pointer button. Secondary buttons MUST
			NOT fire EVENT{dblclick} events.

			<p class="note">
			Canceling the EVENT{click} event does not affect the firing of a
			EVENT{dblclick} event.
			</p>

			As with the EVENT{click} event type, the <a>default action</a> of
			the EVENT{dblclick} event type varies based on the <a>event
			target</a> of the event and the value of the {{MouseEvent/button}}
			or {{MouseEvent/buttons}} attributes. The typical
			<a>default actions</a> of the EVENT{dblclick} event type match those
			of the EVENT{click} event type.

			A <a>user agent</a> MUST dispatch this event when a pointing device
			button is pressed over an element.

			<p class="note">
			Many implementations use the EVENT{mousedown} event to begin a
			variety of contextually dependent <a>default actions</a>. These
			default actions can be prevented if this event is canceled. Some of
			these default actions could include: beginning a drag/drop
			interaction with an image or link, starting text selection, etc.
			Additionally, some implementations provide a mouse-driven panning
			feature that is activated when the middle mouse button is pressed at
			the time the EVENT{mousedown} event is dispatched.

			A <a>user agent</a> MUST dispatch this event when a pointing device
			is moved while it is over an element.  The frequency rate of events
			while the pointing device is moved is implementation-, device-, and
			platform-specific, but multiple consecutive EVENT{mousemove} events
			SHOULD be fired for sustained pointer-device movement, rather than a
			single event for each instance of mouse movement.  Implementations
			are encouraged to determine the optimal frequency rate to balance
			responsiveness with performance.

			<p class="note">
			In some implementation environments, such as a browser,
			EVENT{mousemove} events can continue to fire if the user began a
			drag operation (e.g., a mouse button is pressed) and the pointing
			device has left the boundary of the user agent.
			</p>

			<p class="note" id="mousemove-now-cancelable">
			This event was formerly specified to be non-cancelable in DOM Level
			2 Events, but was changed to reflect existing interoperability between
			user agents.

			A <a>user agent</a> MUST dispatch this event when a pointing device
			button is released over an element.

			<p class="note">
			In some implementation environments, such as a browser, a
			EVENT{mouseup} event can be dispatched even if the pointing device
			has left the boundary of the user agent, e.g., if the user began a
			drag operation with a mouse button pressed.
