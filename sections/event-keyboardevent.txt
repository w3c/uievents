<h3 id="events-keyboardevents">Keyboard Events</h3>

	Keyboard events are device dependent, i.e., they rely on the capabilities of
	the input devices and how they are mapped in the operating systems. Refer to
	<a href="#keys">Keyboard events and key values</a> for more details,
	including examples on how Keyboard Events are used in combination with
	Composition Events. Depending on the character generation device, keyboard
	events might not be generated.

	<p class="note">
	Keyboard events are only one modality of providing textual input. For
	editing scenarios, consider also using the {{InputEvent}} as an alternate to
	(or in addition to) keyboard events.
	</p>

	<h4 id="interface-keyboardevent">Interface KeyboardEvent</h4>

		<p class="intro-dom">Introduced in this specification</p>

		The {{KeyboardEvent}} interface provides specific contextual information
		associated with keyboard devices. Each keyboard event references a key
		using a value. Keyboard events are commonly directed at the element that
		has the focus.

		The {{KeyboardEvent}} interface provides convenient attributes for some
		common modifiers keys: {{KeyboardEvent/ctrlKey}},
		{{KeyboardEvent/shiftKey}}, {{KeyboardEvent/altKey}},
		{{KeyboardEvent/metaKey}}. These attributes are equivalent to using the
		method {{KeyboardEvent/getModifierState()}} with KEYCAP{Control},
		KEYCAP{Shift}, KEYCAP{Alt}, or KEYCAP{Meta} respectively.

		To create an instance of the {{KeyboardEvent}} interface, use the
		{{KeyboardEvent}} constructor, passing an optional
		{{KeyboardEventInit}} dictionary.

	<div class="warning">
	Legacy keyboard event implementations include three additional attributes,
	<code>keyCode</code>, <code>charCode</code>, and <code>which</code>. The
	<code>keyCode</code> attribute indicates a numeric value associated with a
	particular key on a computer keyboard, while the <code>charCode</code>
	attribute indicates the <abbr title="American Standard Code for
	Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> value of the character associated
	with that key (which might be the same as the <code>keyCode</code> value)
	and is applicable only to keys that produce a <a>character value</a>.

	In practice, <code>keyCode</code> and <code>charCode</code> are inconsistent
	across platforms and even the same implementation on different operating
	systems or using different localizations. This specification does not define
	values for either <code>keyCode</code> or <code>charCode</code>, or behavior
	for <code>charCode</code>. In conforming UI Events implementations, content
	authors can instead use {{KeyboardEvent/key}} and {{KeyboardEvent/code}}.

	<em>For more information, see the informative appendix on
	<a href="#legacy-key-attributes">Legacy key attributes</a>.</em>

	<p class="note">
	For compatibility with existing content, virtual keyboards, such as software
	keyboards on screen-based input devices, are expected to produce the normal
	range of keyboard events, even though they do not possess physical keys.

	<p class="note">
	In some implementations or system configurations, some key events, or their
	values, might be suppressed by the <a>IME</a> in use.

		The <a>event target</a> of a key event is the currently focused element
		which is processing the keyboard activity. This is often an HTML
		<code>input</code> element or a textual element which is editable, but
		MAY be an element defined by the <a>host language</a> to accept keyboard
		input for non-text purposes, such as the activation of an accelerator
		key or trigger of some other behavior. If no suitable element is in
		focus, the event target will be the HTML <a>body element</a> if
		available, otherwise the <a>root element</a>.

		<p class="note">
		The <a>event target</a> might change between different key events. For
		example, a EVENT{keydown} event for the KEYCAP{Tab} key will likely have
		a different <a>event target</a> than the  EVENT{keyup} event on the same

			A <a>user agent</a> MUST dispatch this event when a key is pressed
			down. The EVENT{keydown} event type is device dependent and relies
			on the capabilities of the input devices and how they are mapped in
			the operating system. This event type MUST be generated after the
			<a>key mapping</a>. This event type MUST be dispatched before the
			EVENT{beforeinput}, EVENT{input}, and EVENT{keyup} events associated
			with the same key.

			The default action of the EVENT{keydown} event depends upon the key:

			*	If the key is associated with a character, the default action
				MUST be to dispatch a EVENT{beforeinput} event followed by an
				EVENT{input} event. In the case where the key which is
				associated with multiple characters (such as with a macro or
				certain sequences of dead keys), the default action MUST be to
				dispatch one set of EVENT{beforeinput} / EVENT{input} events for
				each character

			*	If the key is associated with a <a>text composition system</a>,
				the default action MUST be to launch that system

			*	If the key is the KEYCAP{Tab} key, the default action MUST be
				to shift the document focus from the currently focused element
				(if any) to the new focused element, as described in
				<a href="#events-focusevent">Focus Event Types</a>

			*	If the key is the KEYCAP{Enter} or KEYCAP{&nbsp;} (Space) key and the
				current focus is on a state-changing element, the default action
				MUST be to dispatch a EVENT{click} event, and a
				EVENT{DOMActivate} event if that event type is supported by the
				<a>user agent</a>.

			If this event is canceled, the associated event types MUST NOT be
			dispatched, and the associated actions MUST NOT be performed.

			<p class="note">
			The EVENT{keydown} and EVENT{keyup} events are traditionally
			associated with detecting any key, not just those which produce a
			<a>character value</a>.
