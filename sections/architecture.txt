<h3 id="event-flow">Event dispatch and DOM event flow</h3>

    This section gives a brief overview of the event <a>dispatch</a> mechanism
    and describes how events propagate through the DOM tree. Applications can
    dispatch event objects using the {{EventTarget/dispatchEvent()}} method, and
    the event object will propagatae through the DOM tree as determined by the
    DOM event flow.

    </figure>

    Event objects are dispatched to an <a>event target</a>. But before dispatch
    can begin, the event object's <a>propagation path</a> must first be
    determined.

    The <a>propagation path</a> is an ordered list of <a>current event
    targets</a> through which the event passes. This propagation path reflects
    the hierarchical tree structure of the document. The last item in the list
    is the <a>event target</a>, and the preceding items in the list are referred
    to as the <em>target's ancestors</em>, with the immediately preceding item
    as the <em>target's parent</em>.

    Once the <a>propagation path</a> has been determined, the event object
    passes through one or more <a>event phases</a>. There are three event
    phases: <a>capture phase</a>, <a>target phase</a> and <a>bubble phase</a>.
    Event objects complete these phases as described below. A phase will be
    skipped if it is not supported, or if the event object's propagation has
    been stopped. For example, if the {{Event/bubbles}} attribute is set to
    false, the bubble phase will be skipped, and if {{Event/stopPropagation()}}
    has been called prior to the dispatch, all phases will be skipped.

    *   The <strong>capture phase</strong>: The event object propagates
        through the target's ancestors from the <a>Window</a> to the target's
        parent. This phase is also known as the <em>capturing phase</em>.

    *   The <strong>target phase</strong>: The event object arrives at the event
        object's <a>event target</a>. This phase is also known as the
        <em>at-target phase</em>. If the <a>event type</a> indicates that the
        event doesn't bubble, then the event object will halt after completion
        of this phase.

    *   The <strong>bubble phase</strong>: The event object propagates through
        the target's ancestors in reverse order, starting with the target's
        parent and ending with the <a>Window</a>. This phase is also known as
        the <em>bubbling phase</em>.


<h3 id="event-flow-default-cancel">Default actions and cancelable events</h3>

    Events are typically dispatched by the implementation as a result of a user
    action, in response to the completion of a task, or to signal progress
    during asynchronous activity (such as a network request). Some events can be
    used to control the behavior that the implementation may take next (or undo
    an action that the implementation already took). Events in this category are
    said to be <em>cancelable</em> and the behavior they cancel is called their
    <em><a>default action</a></em>. Cancelable event objects can be associated
    with one or more 'default actions'. To cancel an event, call the
    {{Event/preventDefault()}} method.

    <p class="example">
    A EVENT{mousedown} event is dispatched immediately after the user presses
    down a button on a pointing device (typically a mouse). One possible
    <a>default action</a> taken by the implementation is to set up a state
    machine that allows the user to drag images or select text. The <a>default
    action</a> depends on what happens next &mdash; for example, if the user's
    pointing device is over text, a text selection might begin. If the user's
    pointing device is over an image, then an image-drag action could begin.
    Preventing the <a>default action</a> of a EVENT{mousedown} event prevents
    these actions from occurring.
    </p>

    <a>Default actions</a> are usually be performed after the event dispatch has
    been completed, but in exceptional cases they may also be performed
    immediately before the event is dispatched.

    <p class="example">
    The default action associated with the EVENT{click} event on <code>&lt;input
    type="checkbox"&gt;</code> elements toggles the <code>checked</code> IDL
    attribute value of that element. If the EVENT{click} event's default action
    is cancelled, then the value is restored to its former state.
    </p>

    When an event is canceled, then the conditional <a>default actions</a>
    associated with the event is skipped (or as mentioned above, if the
    <a>default actions</a> are carried out before the dispatch, their effect
    is undone). Whether an event object is cancelable is indicated by
    the {{Event/cancelable}} attribute. Calling {{Event/preventDefault()}} stops all
    related <a>default actions</a> of an event object. The
    {{Event/defaultPrevented}} attribute indicates whether an event has already
    been canceled (e.g., by a prior event listener). If the <a>DOM
    application</a> itself initiated the dispatch, then the return value of the
    {{EventTarget/dispatchEvent()}} method indicates whether the event object
    was cancelled.

    <p class="note">Many implementations additionally interpret an event
    listener's return value, such as the value <code>false</code>, to mean that
    the <a>default action</a> of cancelable events will be cancelled (though
    <code>window.onerror</code> handlers are cancelled by returning
    <code>true</code>).
    </p>

<h3 id="sync-async">Synchronous and asynchronous events</h3>

    Events may be dispatched either synchronously or asynchronously.

    Events which are synchronous (<em><q>sync events</q></em>) are treated
    as if they are in a virtual queue in a first-in-first-out model, ordered by
    sequence of temporal occurrence with respect to other events, to changes in
    the DOM, and to user interaction.  Each event in this virtual queue is
    delayed until the previous event has completed its propagation behavior, or
    been canceled.  Some sync events are driven by a specific device or process,
    such as mouse button events. These events are governed by the <a>event
    order</a> algorithms defined for that set of events, and user agents will
    dispatch these events in the defined order.

    Events which are asynchronous (<em><q>async events</q></em>) may be
    dispatched as the results of the action are completed, with no relation to
    other events, to other changes in the DOM, nor to user interaction.

    <p class="example">
    During loading of a document, an inline script element is parsed and
    executed. The EVENT{load} event is queued to be fired
    asynchronously at the script element. However, because it is an async event,
    its order with relation to other synchronous events fired during document
    load (such as the <code class="eventtype">DOMContentLoaded</code> event from
    [[!HTML5]]) is not guaranteed.
    </p>

<h3 id="trusted-events">Trusted events</h3>

    Events that are generated by the <a>user agent</a>, either as a result of user
    interaction, or as a direct result of changes to the DOM, are trusted by the
    <a>user agent</a> with privileges that are not afforded to events generated by
    script through the {{Document/createEvent()}} method, modified
    using the {{Event/initEvent()}} method, or dispatched via the
    {{EventTarget/dispatchEvent()}} method.  The {{Event/isTrusted}} attribute
    of trusted events has a value of <code>true</code>, while untrusted events
    have a {{Event/isTrusted}} attribute value of <code>false</code>.

    Most untrusted events will not trigger <a>default actions</a>, with the
    exception of the EVENT{click} event. This event always
    triggers the <a>default action</a>, even if the {{Event/isTrusted}}
    attribute is <code>false</code> (this behavior is retained for
    backward-compatibility). All other untrusted events behave as if the
    {{Event/preventDefault()}} method had been called on that event.


<h3 id="event-flow-activation">Activation triggers and behavior</h3>

    Certain <a>event targets</a> (such as a link or button element) may have
    associated <a>activation behavior</a> (such a following a link) that
    implementations perform in response to an <em><a>activation
    trigger</a></em> (such as clicking a link).

    <p class="example" id="example-activation">
    Both HTML and SVG have an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element which indicates a
    link.  Relevant <a>activation triggers</a> for an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
    element are a EVENT{click} event on the text or image content
    of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, or a EVENT{keydown}
    event with a {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute value of KEY{Enter} key when
    the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element has focus.  The activation behavior for
    an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element is normally to change the content of the
    window to the content of the new document, in the case of external links,
    or to reposition the current document relative to the new anchor, in the
    case of internal links.
    </p>

    An <a>activation trigger</a> is a user action or an event which indicates
    to the implementation that an activation behavior should be initiated.
    User-initiated <a>activation triggers</a> include clicking a mouse button
    on an activatable element, pressing the KEYCAP{Enter} key when an activatable
    element has focus, or pressing a key that is somehow linked to an
    activatable element (a <q>hotkey</q> or <q>access key</q>) even when that
    element does not have focus.  Event-based <a>activation triggers</a> may
    include timer-based events that activate an element at a certain clock time
    or after a certain time period has elapsed, progress events after a certain
    action has been completed, or many other condition-based or state-based
    events.


<h3 id="event-constructors">Constructing Mouse and Keyboard Events</h3>

    Generally, when a constructor of an {{Event}} interface, or of an interface
    inherited from the {{Event}} interface, is invoked, the steps described in
    [[!DOM]] should be followed. However the {{KeyboardEvent}} and
    {{MouseEvent}} interfaces provide additional dictionary members for
    initializing the internal state of the {{Event}} object's key modifiers:
    specifically, the internal state queried for using the
    {{KeyboardEvent/getModifierState()}} and {{MouseEvent/getModifierState()}}
    methods. This section supplements the DOM4 steps for intializing a new
    {{Event}} object with these optional modifier states.

    For the purposes of constructing a {{KeyboardEvent}}, {{MouseEvent}}, or
    object derived from these objects using the algorithm below, all
    {{KeyboardEvent}}, {{MouseEvent}}, and derived objects have
    <dfn id="internal-key-modifier-state">internal key modifier state</dfn> which can be set and
    retrieved using the <a href="#keys-modifiers">key modifier names</a>
    described in the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/#keys-modifier">Modifier Keys table</a>
    in [[UIEvents-Key]].

    The following steps supplement the algorithm defined for constructing
    events in DOM4:

    *   If the {{Event}} being constructed is a {{KeyboardEvent}} or
        {{MouseEvent}} object or an object that derives from either of these,
        and a {{EventModifierInit}} argument was provided to the constructor,
        then run the following sub-steps:

        *   For each {{EventModifierInit}} argument, if the dictionary member
            begins with the string <code>"modifier"</code>, then let the
            <dfn id="modifier-key-name">key modifier name</dfn> be the
            dictionary member's name excluding the prefix
            <code>"modifier"</code>, and set the {{Event}} object's
            <a href="#internal-key-modifier-state">internal key modifier state</a>
            that matches the <a href="#modifier-key-name">key modifier name</a>
            to the corresponding value.
