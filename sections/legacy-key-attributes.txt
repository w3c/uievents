<h2 id="legacy-key-attributes">Legacy Key &amp; Mouse Event Attributes</h2>


<em>This section is non-normative. The following attributes are obsolete and should
only be implemented by <a>user agents</a> that require compatibility with legacy
software that requires these keyboard events.</em>

These features were never formally specified and the current browser
implementations vary in significant ways. The large amount of legacy content,
including script libraries, that relies upon detecting the <a>user agent</a> and
acting accordingly means that any attempt to formalize these legacy attributes
and events would risk breaking as much content as it would fix or enable.
Additionally, these attributes are not suitable for international usage, nor do
they address accessibility concerns.

Therefore, this specification does not normatively define the events and
attributes commonly employed for handling keyboard input, though they MAY be
present in <a>user agents</a> for compatibility with legacy content. Authors
SHOULD use the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute instead of the
{{KeyboardEvent/charCode}} and {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} attributes.

However, for the purpose of documenting the current state of these features and
their relation to normative events and attributes, this section provides an
informative description. For implementations which do support these attributes
and events, it is suggested that the definitions provided in this section be
used.


<h3 id="legacy-UIEvent">Legacy {{UIEvent}} supplemental interface</h3>

	<em>This section is non-normative</em>

	[=User agents=] have traditionally included a {{UIEvent/which}} attribute so that
	{{KeyboardEvent}}s and {{MouseEvent}}s could record supplemental event info.
	
	<p class="note">
	Previous versions of this specification defined separate {{UIEvent/which}} attributes
	directly on {{KeyboardEvent}} and {{MouseEvent}} rather than having a shared
	{{UIEvent/which}} attribute defined on {{UIEvent}}.
	</p>

	<h4 id="legacy-interface-UIEvent">Interface UIEvent (supplemental)</h4>

		The partial {{UIEvent}} interface is an informative extension of the {{UIEvent}}
		interface, which adds the {{UIEvent/which}} attribute.

		<pre class="idl">
		partial interface UIEvent {
		  // The following support legacy user agents
		  readonly attribute unsigned long which;
		};
		</pre>

		<dl dfn-for="UIEvent">
			<dt><dfn attribute>which</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
				For {{MouseEvent}}s, this contains a value equal to the value stored in
				{{MouseEvent/button}}+1.
				For {{KeyboardEvent}}s, this holds a system- and implementation-dependent
				numerical code signifying the unmodified identifier associated
				with the key pressed. In most cases, the value is identical to
				{{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}}.
			</dd>
		</dl>

	<h4 id="legacy-dictionary-UIEventInit">Interface UIEventInit (supplemental)</h4>

		Browsers that include support for {{UIEvent/which}} in
		{{UIEvent}} should also add the following members to the
		{{UIEventInit}} dictionary.

		The partial {{UIEventInit}} dictionary is an informative extension
		of the {{UIEventInit}} dictionary, which adds the
		{{UIEvent/which}} member to initialize the corresponding
		{{UIEvent}} attributes.

		<pre class="idl-ignore" data-no-idl data-highlight="webidl">
		partial dictionary UIEventInit {
		  unsigned long which = 0;
		};
		</pre>

		<dl dfn-for="UIEventInit">
			<dt><dfn unknown>which</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
				Initializes the {{UIEvent/which}} attribute of the
				{{UIEvent}}.
			</dd>
		</dl>


<h3 id="legacy-KeyboardEvent">Legacy {{KeyboardEvent}} supplemental interface</h3>

	<em>This section is non-normative</em>

	Browser support for keyboards has traditionally relied on three ad-hoc
	attributes, {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}}, {{KeyboardEvent/charCode}}, and
	{{UIEvent}}'s {{UIEvent/which}}.

	All three of these attributes return a numerical code that represents some
	aspect of the key pressed: {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} is an index of the key
	itself. {{KeyboardEvent/charCode}} is the ASCII value of the character keys.
	{{UIEvent/which}} is the character value where available and otherwise
	the key index. The values for these attributes, and the availability of the
	attribute, is inconsistent across platforms, keyboard languages and layouts,
	<a>user agents</a>, versions, and even event types.

	<h4 id="legacy-interface-KeyboardEvent">Interface KeyboardEvent (supplemental)</h4>

		The partial {{KeyboardEvent}} interface is an informative extension of
		the {{KeyboardEvent}} interface, which adds the
		{{KeyboardEvent/charCode}} and {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} attributes.

		The partial {{KeyboardEvent}} interface can be obtained by using the
		{{Document/createEvent()}} method call in
		implementations that support this extension.

		<pre class="idl">
		partial interface KeyboardEvent {
		  // The following support legacy user agents
		  readonly attribute unsigned long charCode;
		  readonly attribute unsigned long keyCode;
		};
		</pre>

		<dl dfn-for="KeyboardEvent">
			<dt><dfn attribute>charCode</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
				{{KeyboardEvent/charCode}} holds a character value, for
				EVENT{keypress} events which generate character input. The value
				is the Unicode reference number (code point) of that character
				(e.g. <code>event.charCode = event.key.charCodeAt(0)</code> for
				printable characters). For EVENT{keydown} or EVENT{keyup}
				events, the value of {{KeyboardEvent/charCode}} is
				<code>0</code>.
			</dd>

			<dt><dfn attribute>keyCode</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
				{{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} holds a system- and
				implementation-dependent numerical code signifying the
				unmodified identifier associated with the key pressed. Unlike
				the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute, the set of possible values
				are not normatively defined in this specification. Typically,
				these value of the {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} SHOULD represent
				the decimal codepoint in ASCII [[RFC20]][[US-ASCII]] or Windows
				1252 [[WIN1252]], but MAY be drawn from a different appropriate
				character set. Implementations that are unable to identify a key
				use the key value KEYCAP{0}.

				See [[#legacy-key-models]] for more details on how to determine
				the values for {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}}.
			</dd>

	<h4 id="legacy-dictionary-KeyboardEventInit">Interface KeyboardEventInit (supplemental)</h4>

		Browsers that include support for {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}},
		{{KeyboardEvent/charCode}}, and {{UIEvent/which}} in
		{{KeyboardEvent}} should also add the following members to the
		{{KeyboardEventInit}} dictionary.

		The partial {{KeyboardEventInit}} dictionary is an informative extension
		of the {{KeyboardEventInit}} dictionary, which adds
		{{KeyboardEvent/charCode}}, {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}}, and
		{{UIEvent/which}} members to initialize the corresponding
		{{KeyboardEvent}} attributes.

		<pre class="idl-ignore" data-no-idl data-highlight="webidl">

		  // The following support legacy user agents
		  unsigned long charCode = 0;
		  unsigned long keyCode = 0;

		<dl dfn-for="KeyboardEventInit">
			<dt><dfn unknown>charCode</dfn></dt>

				{{KeyboardEvent}} to the Unicode code point for the event's
				character.
			</dd>

			<dt><dfn unknown>keyCode</dfn></dt>
			<dd>

			</dd>
		</dl>

<h3 id="legacy-key-models">Legacy key models</h3>

	<em>This section is non-normative</em>

	Implementations differ on which values are exposed on these attributes for
	different event types. An implementation MAY choose to expose both virtual
	key codes and character codes in the {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} property
	(<em>conflated model</em>), or report separate {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} and
	{{KeyboardEvent/charCode}} properties (<em>split model</em>).

	<h4 id="determine-keydown-keyup-keyCode">How to determine {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} for EVENT{keydown} and EVENT{keyup} events</h4>

		The {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} for EVENT{keydown} or EVENT{keyup} events
		is calculated as follows:

		*	Read the virtual key code from the operating system's event
			information, if such information is available.

		*	If an Input Method Editor is processing key input and the event is
			EVENT{keydown}, return 229.

		*	If input key when pressed without modifiers would insert a numerical
			character (0-9), return the ASCII code of that numerical character.

		*	If input key when pressed without modifiers would insert a lower
			case character in the a-z alphabetical range, return the ASCII code
			of the upper case equivalent.

		*	If the implementation supports a key code conversion table for the
			operating system and platform, look up the value. If the conversion
			table specifies an alternate virtual key value for the given input,
			return the specified value.

		*	If the key's function, as determined in an implementation-specific
			way, corresponds to one of the keys in the
			[[#fixed-virtual-key-codes]] table, return the corresponding key
			code.

		*	Return the virtual key code from the operating system.

		*	If no key code was found, return 0.

	<h4 id="determine-keypress-keyCode">How to determine {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} for EVENT{keypress} events</h4>

		The {{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} for EVENT{keypress} events is calculated
		as follows:

		*	If the implementation supports a <em>conflated model</em>, set
			{{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} to the Unicode code point of the character
			being entered.

		*	If the implementation supports a <em>split model</em>, set
			{{KeyboardEvent/keyCode}} to 0.

	<h4 id="fixed-virtual-key-codes">Fixed virtual key codes</h4>

		The virtual key codes for the following keys do not usually change with
		keyboard layouts on desktop systems:
