<h3 id="events-wheelevents">Wheel Events</h3>

	Wheels are devices that can be rotated in one or more spatial dimensions, and which can be associated with a pointer device. The coordinate system depends on the
	environment configuration.

	<p class="example">
	The user's environment might be configured to associate vertical scrolling
	with rotation along the y-axis, horizontal scrolling with rotation along the
	x-axis, and zooming with rotation along the z-axis.
	</p>

	The deltaX, deltaY, and deltaZ attributes of {{WheelEvent}} objects indicate
	a measurement along their respective axes in units of pixels, lines, or
	pages. The reported measurements are provided after an environment-specific
	algorithm translates the actual rotation/movement of the wheel device into
	the appropriate values and units.

	<p class="note">
	A user's environment settings can be customized to interpret actual rotation/movement
	of a wheel device in different ways.
	One movement of a common <q>dented</q> mouse wheel can produce a measurement of 162 pixels
	(162 is just an example value, actual values can depend on the current screen
	dimensions of the user-agent).
	But a user can change their default environment settings to speed-up their mouse wheel,
	increasing this number.
	Furthermore, some mouse wheel software can support acceleration (the faster the wheel
	is rotated/moved, the greater the <a>delta</a> of each measurement) or even sub-pixel <a>rotation</a>
	measurements.
	Because of this, authors can not assume a given <a>rotation</a> amount in one user agent will
	produce the same <a>delta</a> value in all user agents.
	</p>

	The sign (positive or negative) of the values of the deltaX, deltaY, and deltaZ attributes
	MUST be consistent between multiple dispatches of the
	EVENT{wheel} event while the
	motion of the actual wheel device is rotating/moving in the same direction.
	If a user agent scrolls as the default action of the
	EVENT{wheel} event then the sign
	of the <a>delta</a> SHOULD be given by a right-hand coordinate system where positive X,
	Y, and Z axes are directed towards the right-most edge, bottom-most edge, and farthest
	depth (away from the user) of the document, respectively.

	<p class="note">
	Individual user agents can (depending on their environment and hardware configuration)
	interpret the same physical user interaction on the wheel differently.
	For example, a vertical swipe on the edge of a trackpad from top to bottom can be
	interpreted as a wheel action intended to either scroll the
	page down or to pan the page up (i.e., resulting in either a positive or negative
	deltaY value respectively).
	</p>

	A <a>user agent</a> MUST create a <a>wheel event transaction</a> when the first wheel event
	is fired, so that all subsequent wheel events within a implementation-specific amount of
	time can be targetted at the same element. A <dfn>wheel event transaction</dfn> is series of
	wheel events that are associated with a single user gesture. The
	<a>wheel event transaction</a> MUST have an associated event target that is the
	<a>topmost event target</a> at the time the first wheel event occurs in the group.

	<p class="example">
	If a series of wheel events targetted in a scrollable element start above a child element,
	later events for the same user gesture may occur over the child element.
	</p>

		<p class="intro-dom">Introduced in this specification</p>

		The {{WheelEvent}} interface provides specific contextual information

		To create an instance of the {{WheelEvent}} interface, use the {{WheelEvent}} constructor,
		passing an optional {{WheelEventInit}} dictionary.

			A <a>user agent</a> MUST dispatch this event when a mouse wheel has
			been rotated around any axis, or when an equivalent input device
			(such as a mouse-ball, certain tablets or touchpads, etc.) has
			emulated such an action. Depending on the platform and input device,
			diagonal wheel <a>deltas</a> MAY be delivered either as a single
			EVENT{wheel} event with multiple non-zero axes or as separate
			EVENT{wheel} events for each non-zero axis.

			The typical <a>default action</a> of the EVENT{wheel} event type is
			to scroll (or in some cases, zoom) the document by the indicated
			amount.  If this event is canceled, the implementation MUST NOT
			scroll or zoom the document (or perform whatever other
			implementation-specific default action is associated with this event
			type).

			<p class="note">
			In some <a>user agents</a>, or with some input devices, the speed
			that the wheel has been turned can affect the <a>delta</a> values,
			with a faster speed producing a higher <a>delta</a> value.
			</p>

		<h5 id="cancelability-of-wheel-events">cancelability of wheel events</h5>
			<p>
			Calling <code>preventDefault</code> on a wheel event can prevent
			or otherwise interrupt scrolling. For maximum scroll performance, a
			user agent may not wait for each wheel event associated with the scroll
			to be processed to see if it will be canceled. In such cases the user
			agent should generate <code>wheel</code> events whose
			<code>cancelable</code> property is <code>false</code>, indicating that
			<code>preventDefault</code> cannot be used to prevent or interrupt
			scrolling. Otherwise <code>cancelable</code> will be <code>true</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
			In particular, a user agent should generate only uncancelable
			<code>wheel</code> events when it
			<a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#observing-event-listeners">observes
			that there are no non-passive listeners</a> for the event.
