<h3 id="keyboard-input">Keyboard Input</h3>

	<em>This section is non-normative</em>

	The relationship of each key to the complete keyboard has three separate
	aspects, each of which vary among different models and configurations of
	keyboards, particularly for locale-specific reasons:

	*	<strong>Mechanical layout:</strong> the dimensions, size, and placement
		of the physical keys on the keyboard
	*	<strong>Visual markings:</strong> the labels (or <em>legends</em>) that
		mark each key
	*	<strong>Functional mapping:</strong> the abstract key-value association
		of each key.

	This specification only defines the functional mapping, in terms of
	<a href="#keys-keyvalues"><code>key</code></a> values and
	<a href="#keys-codevalues"><code>code</code></a> values,
	but briefly describes <a href="#key-legends">key legends</a>
	for background.

	<h4 id="key-legends">Key Legends</h4>

		<em>This section is informative</em>

		The key legend is the visual marking that is printed or embossed on the
		<em>key cap</em> (the rectangular "cap" that covers the mechanical
		switch for the key). These markings normally consist of one or more
		characters that a keystroke on that key will produce (such as GLYPH{G},
		GLYPH{8}, or GLYPH{ш}), or names or symbols which indicate that key's
		function (such as an upward-pointing arrow GLYPH{&#x21E7;} indicating
		KEYCAP{Shift}, or the string <code>"Enter"</code>). Keys are often
		referred to by this marking (e.g., <q>Press the <code>"Shift"</code> and
		<code>"G"</code> keys.</q>). Note, however, that the visual appearance
		of the key has no bearing on its digital representation, and in many
		configurations may be completely inaccurate. Even the control and
		function keys, such as KEYCAP{Enter}, may be mapped to different
		functionality, or even mapped as character keys.

		<p class="note">
		Many keyboards contain keys that do not normally produce any characters,
		even though the symbol might have a Unicode equivalent. For example, the
		KEYCAP{Shift} key might bear the symbol GLYPH{&#x21E7;}, which has the
		Unicode code point UNI{U+21E7}, but
		pressing the KEYCAP{Shift} key will not produce this character value,
		and there is no Unicode code point for KEYCAP{Shift}.

<h3 id="keys-codevalues">Key codes</h3>

	A key {{KeyboardEvent/code}} is an attribute of a keyboard event that can be
	used to identify the physical key associated with the keyboard event. It is
	similar to USB Usage IDs in that it provides a low-level value (similar to a
	scancode) that is vendor-neutral.

	The primary purpose of the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute is to provide a
	consistent and coherent way to identify keys based on their physical
	location. In addition, it also provides a stable name (unaffected by the
	current keyboard state) that uniquely identifies each key on the keyboard.

	The list of valid {{KeyboardEvent/code}} values is defined in the
	[[!UIEvents-Code]].

	<h4 id="code-motivation">Motivation for the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} Attribute</h4>

		The standard PC keyboard has a set of keys (which we refer to as
		<em>writing system keys</em>) that generate different
		{{KeyboardEvent/key}} values based on the current keyboard layout
		selected by the user. This situation makes it difficult to write code
		that detects keys based on their physical location since the code would
		need to know which layout is in effect in order to know which
		{{KeyboardEvent/key}} values to check for. A real-world example of this
		is a game that wants to use the GLYPH{W}, GLYPH{A}, GLYPH{S} and
		GLYPH{D} keys to control player movement. The {{KeyboardEvent/code}}
		attribute solves this problem by providing a stable value to check that
		is <em>not affected by the current keyboard layout</em>.

		In addition, the values in the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute depend as
		well on the current keyboard state. Because of this, the order in which
		keys are pressed and released in relation to modifier keys can affect
		the values stored in the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute. The
		{{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute solves this problem by providing a
		stable value that is <em>not affected by the current keyboard state</em>.

	<h4 id="code-virtual-keyboards">{{KeyboardEvent/code}} and Virtual Keyboards</h4>

		The usefulness of the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute is less obvious
		for virtual keyboards (and also for remote controls and chording
		keyboards). In general, if a virtual (or remote control) keyboard is
		mimicking the layout and functionality of a standard keyboard, then it
		MUST also set the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute as appropriate. For
		keyboards which are not mimicking the layout of a standard keyboard,
		then the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute MAY be set to the closest
		match on a standard keyboard or it MAY be left undefined.

		For virtual keyboards with keys that produce different values based on
		some modifier state, the {{KeyboardEvent/code}} value should be the
		{{KeyboardEvent/key}} value generated when the button is pressed while
		the device is in its factory-reset state.

<h3 id="keys-keyvalues">Keyboard Event <code>key</code> Values</h3>

	A key value is a <code>DOMString</code> that can be used to indicate any
	given key on a keyboard, regardless of position or state, by the value it
	produces.  These key values MAY be used as return values for keyboard events
	generated by the implementation, or as input values by the content author to
	specify desired input (such as for keyboard shortcuts).

	The list of valid <code>key</code> values is defined in [[!UIEvents-Key]].

	Key values can be used to detect the value of a key which has been pressed,
	using the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute.  Content authors can retrieve the
	<a>character value</a> of upper- or lower-case letters, number, symbols, or
	other character-producing keys, and also the <a>key value</a> of control
	keys, modifier keys, function keys, or other keys that do not generate
	characters. These values can be used for monitoring particular input
	strings, for detecting and acting on modifier key input in combination with
	other inputs (such as a mouse), for creating virtual keyboards, or for any
	number of other purposes.

	Key values can also be used by content authors in string comparisons, as
	values for markup attributes (such as the HTML <code>accesskey</code>) in
	conforming <a>host languages</a>, or for other related purposes.   A
	conforming <a>host language</a> SHOULD allow content authors to use either
	of the two equivalent string values for a key value: the <a>character
	value</a>, or the <a>key value</a>.

	<p class="note">
	While implementations will use the most relevant value for a key
	independently of the platform or keyboard layout mappings, content authors
	can not make assumptions on the ability of keyboard devices to generate
	them.  When using keyboard events and key values for shortcut-key
	combinations, content authors can <q>consider using numbers and function
	keys (KEYCAP{F4}, KEYCAP{F5}, and so on) instead of letters</q> ([[DWW95]])
	given that most keyboard layouts will provide keys for those.
	</p>

	A key value does not indicate a specific key on the physical keyboard, nor
	does it reflect the character printed on the key. A key value indicates the
	current value of the event with consideration to the current state of all
	active keys and key input modes (including shift modes), as reflected in the
	operating-system mapping of the keyboard and reported to the implementation.
	In other words, the key value for the key labeled KEYCAP{O} on a
	<a>QWERTY</a> keyboard has the key value KEY_NOLINK{o} in an unshifted state and
	KEY_NOLINK{O} in a shifted state. Because a user can map their keyboard to an
	arbitrary custom configuration, the content author is encouraged not to
	assume that a relationship exists between the shifted and unshifted states
	of a key and the majuscule form (uppercase or capital letters) and minuscule
	form (lowercase or small letters) of a character representation, but is
	encouraged instead to use the value of the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute.
	For example, the Standard "102" Keyboard layout depicted in [[UIEvents-Code]]
	illustrates one possible set of <a>key mappings</a> on one possible keyboard
	layout. Many others exist, both standard and idiosyncratic.

	<p class="note">
	To simplify <a>dead key</a> support, when the operating-system mapping of
	the keyboard is handling a <a>dead key</a> state, the current state of the
	dead key sequence is not reported via the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute.
	Rather, a key value of KEY{Dead} is reported. Instead, implementations
	generate <a>composition events</a> which
	contain the intermediate state of the dead key sequence reported via the
	{{CompositionEvent/data}} attribute. As in the previous example, the key
	value for the key marked KEYCAP{O} on a <a>QWERTY</a> keyboard has a
	{{CompositionEvent/data}} value of <code class="char">"&#xF6;"</code> in an
	unshifted state during a dead-key operation to add an umlaut diacritic, and
	<code class="char">"&#xD6;"</code> in a shifted state during a dead-key
	operation to add an umlaut diacritic.
	</p>

	It is also important to note that there is not a one-to-one relationship
	between key event states and key values.  A particular key value might be
	associated with multiple keys. For example, many standard keyboards contain
	more than one key with the KEYCAP{Shift} key value (normally distinguished
	by the {{KeyboardEvent/location}} values
	{{KeyboardEvent/DOM_KEY_LOCATION_LEFT}} and
	{{KeyboardEvent/DOM_KEY_LOCATION_RIGHT}}) or KEYCAP{8} key value (normally
	distinguished by the {{KeyboardEvent/location}} values
	{{KeyboardEvent/DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD}} and
	{{KeyboardEvent/DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD}}), and user-configured custom
	keyboard layouts MAY duplicate any key value in multiple key-state scenarios
	(note that {{KeyboardEvent/location}} is intended for standard keyboard
	layouts, and cannot always indicate a meaningful distinction).

	Finally, the meaning of any given character representation is
	context-dependent and complex.  For example, in some contexts, the asterisk
	(star) glyph (GLYPH{*}) represents a footnote or
	emphasis (when bracketing a passage of text). However, in some documents or
	executable programs it is equivalent to the mathematical multiplication
	operation, while in other documents or executable programs, that function is
	reserved for the multiplication symbol (GLYPH{&#xD7;}, Unicode value
	UNI{U+00D7}) or the Latin small letter <code>"x"</code>
	(due to the lack of a multiplication key on many keyboards and the
	superficial resemblance of the glyphs GLYPH{&#xD7;} and GLYPH{x}).  Thus,
	the semantic meaning or function of character representations is outside the
	scope of this specification.

	<h4 id="keys-modifiers">Modifier keys</h4>

		Keyboard input uses modifier keys to change the normal behavior of a
		key. Like other keys, modifier keys generate EVENT{keydown} and
		EVENT{keyup} events, as shown in the example below. Some modifiers are
		activated while the key is being pressed down or maintained pressed such
		as KEYCAP{Alt}, KEYCAP{Control}, KEYCAP{Shift}, KEYCAP{AltGraph}, or
		KEYCAP{Meta}. Other modifiers are activated depending on their state
		such as KEYCAP{CapsLock}, KEYCAP{NumLock}, or KEYCAP{ScrollLock}. Change
		in the state happens when the modifier key is being pressed down. The
		{{KeyboardEvent}} interface provides convenient attributes for some
		common modifiers keys: {{KeyboardEvent/ctrlKey}},
		{{KeyboardEvent/shiftKey}}, {{KeyboardEvent/altKey}},
		{{KeyboardEvent/metaKey}}. Some operating systems simulate the
		KEYCAP{AltGraph} modifier key with the combination of the KEYCAP{Alt}
		and KEYCAP{Control} modifier keys. Implementations are encouraged to use
		the KEYCAP{AltGraph} modifier key.

		<p class="note">
		The value in the EVENT{keydown} and EVENT{keyup} events varies based on
		the current keyboard layout in effect when the key is pressed. This
		means that the KEYCAP{v} key on a US layout and the KEYCAP{ر} key on an
		Arabic layout will generate different events even though they are the
		same physical key. To identify these events as coming from the same
		physical key, you will need to make use of the {{KeyboardEvent/code}}
		attribute.
		</p>

		In some cases, <a>modifier keys</a> change the {{KeyboardEvent/key}}
		value for a key event. For example, on some MacOS keyboards, the  key
		labeled "delete" functions the same as the KEYCAP{Backspace} key on the
		Windows OS when unmodified, but when modified by the KEYCAP{Fn} key,
		acts as the KEYCAP{Delete} key, and the value of {{KeyboardEvent/key}}
		will match the most appropriate function of the key in its current
		modified state.

	<h4 id="keys-dead">Dead keys</h4>

		Some keyboard input uses <a>dead keys</a> for the input of composed
		character sequences. Unlike the handwriting sequence, in which users
		enter the base character first, keyboard input requires to enter a
		special state when a <a>dead key</a> is pressed and emit the
		character(s) only when one of a limited number of <q>legal</q> base
		character is entered.

		<p class="note">
		The MacOS and Linux operating systems use input methods to process
		<a>dead keys</a>.
		</p>

		The <a>dead keys</a> (across all keyboard layouts and mappings) are
		represented by the key value KEYCAP{Dead}. In response to any dead key
		press, <a>composition events</a> must
		be dispatched by the user agent and the EVENT{compositionupdate} event's
		{{CompositionEvent/data}} value must be the character value of the
		current state of the dead key combining sequence.

		While Unicode combining characters always follow the handwriting
		sequence, with the combining character trailing the corresponding
		letter, typical dead key input MAY reverse the sequence, with the
		combining character before the corresponding letter. For example, the
		word <em>naïve</em>, using the combining diacritic <em>¨</em>, would be
		represented sequentially in Unicode as <em>nai¨ve</em>, but MAY be typed
		<em>na¨ive</em>. The sequence of keystrokes UNI{U+0302} (Combining
		Circumflex Accent key) and UNI{U+0065} (key marked with the Latin Small
		Letter E) will likely produce (on a French keyboard using a french
		mapping and without any modifier activated) the Unicode character
		GLYPH{&#xEA;} (Latin Small Letter E With Circumflex), as preferred by
		the Unicode Normalization Form <em>NFC</em>.

	<h4 id="keys-IME">Input Method Editors</h4>

		This specification includes a model for <a>input method editors</a>
		(IMEs), through the {{CompositionEvent}} interface and events.
		However, Composition Events and Keyboard Events do not necessarily map
		as a one-to-one relationship.  As an example, receiving a EVENT{keydown}
		for the KEYCAP{Accept} key value does not necessarily imply that the
		text currently selected in the <a>IME</a> is being accepted, but
		indicates only that a keystroke happened, disconnected from the
		<a>IME</a> Accept functionality (which would normally result in a
		EVENT{compositionend} event in most <a>IME</a> systems).  Keyboard
		events cannot be used to determine the current state of the input method
		editor, which can be obtained through the {{CompositionEvent/data}}
		attribute of the {{CompositionEvent}} interface.  Additionally,
		<a>IME</a> systems and devices vary in their functionality, and in which
		keys are used for activating that functionality, such that the
		KEYCAP{Convert} and KEYCAP{Accept} keys MAY be represented by other
		available keys. Keyboard events correspond to the events generated by
		the input device after the keyboard layout mapping.

		<p class="note">
		In some implementations or system configurations, some key events, or
		their values, might be suppressed by the <a>IME</a> in use.
		</p>

		The following example describes a possible sequence of keys to generate
		the Unicode character GLYPH{&#x5E02;} (Kanji character, part of CJK
		Unified Ideographs) using Japanese input methods. This example assumes
		that the input method editor is activated and in the Japanese-Romaji
		input mode. The keys KEYCAP{Convert} and KEYCAP{Accept} MAY be replaced
		by others depending on the input device in use and the configuration of
		the IME, e.g., it can be respectively UNI{U+0020} (Space key) and
		KEYCAP{Enter}.

		<p class="note">
		GLYPH{&#x8A69;} (<q>poem</q>) and GLYPH{&#x5E02;} (<q>city</q>) are
		homophones, both pronounced &#x3057; (<q>shi</q>/<q>si</q>), so the user
		needs to use the KEYCAP{Convert} key to select the proper option.

		<h5 id="keys-IME-keys">Input Method Editor mode keys</h5>

			Some keys on certain devices are intended to activate <a>input
			method editor</a> functionality, or to change the mode of an active
			<a>input method editor</a>.  Custom keys for this purpose can be
			defined for different devices or language modes. The keys defined in
			this specification for this purpose are: KEY{Alphanumeric},
			KEY{CodeInput}, KEY{FinalMode}, KEY{HangulMode}, KEY{HanjaMode},
			KEY{Hiragana}, KEY{JunjaMode}, KEY{KanaMode}, KEY{KanjiMode},
			KEY{Katakana}, and KEY{Romaji}.  When one of these keys is
			pressed, and no <a>IME</a> is currently active, the appropriate
			<a>IME</a> is expected to be activated in the mode indicated by the
			key (if available). If an <a>IME</a> is already active when the key
			is pressed, the active <a>IME</a> might change to the indicated
			mode, or a different <a>IME</a> might be launched, or the might MAY
			be ignored, on a device- and application-specific basis.

			This specification also defines other keys which are intended for
			operation specifically with <a>input method editors</a>:
			KEY{Accept}, KEY{AllCandidates}, KEY{Cancel}, KEY{Convert},
			KEY{Compose}, KEY{Zenkaku} (FullWidth), KEY{Hankaku} (HalfWidth), KEY{NextCandidate},
			KEY{NonConvert}, and KEY{PreviousCandidate}.  The functions of these
			keys are not defined in this specification &mdash; refer to other
			resources for details on <a>input method editor</a> functionality.

			<p class="note">
			Keys with <a>input method editor</a> functions are not restricted to
			that purpose, and can have other device- or implementation-specific
			purposes.

		Canceling a <a>dead key</a> on a EVENT{keyup} event has no effect on
		EVENT{beforeinput} or EVENT{input} events. The following example uses
