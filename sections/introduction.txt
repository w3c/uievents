<h3 id="ui-events-overview">Overview</h3>

    UI Events is designed with two main goals. The first goal is the design of
    an <a>event</a> system which allows registration of <a>event listeners</a> and
    describes event flow through a tree structure. Additionally, the
    specification will provide standard modules of events for user interface
    control and document mutation notifications, including defined contextual
    information for each of these event modules.

    The second goal of UI Events is to provide a common subset of the current
    event systems used in existing browsers. This is intended to foster
    interoperability of existing scripts and content. It is not expected that
    this goal will be met with full backwards compatibility. However, the
    specification attempts to achieve this when possible.


<h3 id="ui-events-conformance">Conformance</h3>

    <strong>This section is normative.</strong>

    Within this specification, the key words <q>MUST</q>, <q>MUST NOT</q>,
    <q>REQUIRED</q>, <q>SHALL</q>, <q>SHALL NOT</q>, <q>SHOULD</q>,
    <q>SHOULD NOT</q>, <q>RECOMMENDED</q>, <q>MAY</q>, and <q>OPTIONAL</q>
    are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]].

    This specification is to be understood in the context of the DOM Level 3
    Core specification [[!DOM-Level-3-Core]] and the general considerations for DOM
    implementations apply. For example, handling of <a>namespace URIs</a> is
    discussed in
    <a class="normative" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#Namespaces-Considerations"><em>XML Namespaces</em></a>.
    For additional information about
    <a class="normative" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/introduction.html#ID-Conformance"><em>conformance</em></a>,
    please see the DOM Level 3 Core specification [[DOM-Level-3-Core]]. A <a>user
    agent</a> is not required to conform to the entirety of another
    specification in order to conform to this specification, but it MUST conform
    to the specific parts of any other specification which are called out in
    this specification (e.g., a conforming UI Events <a>user agent</a> MUST
    support the <code>DOMString</code> data type as defined in [[WebIDL]], but
    need not support every method or data type defined in [[WebIDL]] in order
    to conform to UI Events).

    This specification defines several classes of conformance for different
    <a>user agents</a>, specifications, and content authors:


    <h4 id="conf-interactive-ua">Web browsers and other dynamic or interactive <a>user agents</a></h4>

        A dynamic or interactive <a>user agent</a>, referred to here as a
        <q>browser</q> (be it a Web browser, AT (Accessibility Technology)
        application, or other similar program), conforms to UI Events if it
        supports:

        *   the Core module defined in [[DOM-Level-3-Core]]

        *   the [[#event-flow]] mechanism

        *   all the interfaces and events with their associated methods,
            attributes, and semantics defined in this specification with the
            exception of those marked as <a>deprecated</a> (a conforming user
            agent MAY implement the deprecated interfaces, events, or APIs for
            backwards compatibility, but is not required to do so in order to be
            conforming)

        *   the complete set of <code>key</code> and <code>code</code>
            values defined in [[UIEvents-Key]] and [[UIEvents-Code]] (subject to
            platform availability), and

        *   all other normative requirements defined in this specification.

        A conforming browser MUST <a>dispatch</a> events appropriate to the
        given {{EventTarget}} when the conditions defined for that <a>event
        type</a> have been met.

        A browser conforms specifically to UI Events if it implements the
        interfaces and related <a>event types</a> specified in [[#event-types]].

        A conforming browser MUST support scripting, declarative interactivity,
        or some other means of detecting and dispatching events in the manner
        described by this specification, and MUST support the APIs specified for
        that <a>event type</a>.

        In addition to meeting all other conformance criteria, a conforming
        browser MAY implement features of this specification marked as
        <a>deprecated</a>, for backwards compatibility with existing content,
        but such implementation is discouraged.

        A conforming browser MAY also support features not found in this
        specification, but which use the [[#event-flow]] mechanism, interfaces,
        events, or other features defined in this specification, and MAY
        implement additional interfaces and <a>event types</a> appropriate to
        that implementation. Such features can be later standardized in future
        specifications.

        A browser which does not conform to all required portions of this
        specification MUST NOT claim conformance to UI Events. Such an
        implementation which does conform to portions of this specification MAY
        claim conformance to those specific portions.

        A conforming browser MUST also be a <i>conforming implementation</i> of
        the IDL fragments in this specification, as described in the Web IDL
        specification [[WebIDL]].

    <h4 id="conf-author-tools">Authoring tools</h4>

        A content authoring tool conforms to UI Events if it produces content
        which uses the <a>event types</a> and [[#event-flow]] model, consistent
        in a manner as defined in this specification.

        A content authoring tool MUST NOT claim conformance to UI Events for
        content it produces which uses features of this specification marked as
        <a>deprecated</a> in this specification.

        A conforming content authoring tool SHOULD provide to the content author
        a means to use all <a>event types</a> and interfaces appropriate to all
        <a>host languages</a> in the content document being produced.

    <h4 id="conf-authors">Content authors and content</h4>

            A content <a>author</a> creates conforming UI Events content if that
            content uses the <a>event types</a> and [[#event-flow]] model,
            consistent in a manner as defined in this specification.

            A content author SHOULD NOT use features of this specification
            marked as <a>deprecated</a>, but SHOULD rely instead upon
            replacement mechanisms defined in this specification and elsewhere.

            Conforming content MUST use the semantics of the interfaces and
            <a>event types</a> as described in this specification.

            <p class="note">
            Content authors are advised to follow best practices as described in
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">accessibility</a> and
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/i18n">internationalization</a>
            guideline specifications.
            </p>

    <h4 id="conf-specs">Specifications and host languages</h4>

        A specification or <a>host language</a> conforms to UI Events if it
        references and uses the [[#event-flow]] mechanism, interfaces, events,
        or other features defined in [[!DOM]], and does not extend
        these features in incompatible ways.

        A specification or <a>host language</a> conforms specifically to UI
        Events if it references and uses the interfaces and related <a>event
        types</a> specified in [[#event-types]]. A conforming specification MAY
        define additional interfaces and <a>event types</a> appropriate to that
        specification, or MAY extend the UI Events interfaces and <a>event
        types</a> in a manner that does not contradict or conflict with the
        definitions of those interfaces and <a>event types</a> in this
        specification.

        Specifications or <a>host languages</a> which reference UI Events SHOULD
        NOT use or recommend features of this specification marked as
        <a>deprecated</a>, but SHOULD use or recommend the indicated replacement
        for that the feature (if available).
