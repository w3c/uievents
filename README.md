## UI Events Specification

This repository if for the [UI Events specification](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/) (formerly known as DOM 3 Events).

## Goals

The goal of the UI/DOM3 Events sub-group, part of the Web Platform Working Group, is to complete the
UI Events specification according to market needs, to drive its adoption and implementation, to provide
a comprehensive test suite (for implementability at least, and hopefully for interoperability, too),
and to move it along the Recommendation Track to W3C Recommendation status.

## Communication

For discussion of matters related to DOM3 Events, the group uses the www-dom@w3.org mailing list ([archive](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/)).

## Meetings

See our [bi-weekly meetings](https://github.com/w3c/uievents/wiki/Meeting-Notes) for detailed status and progress toward getting this spec finished and ready for CR.
