# UI Events

This repository is for the [UI Events specification](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/) (formerly known as DOM 3 Events).

## Goals

The goal of the UI/DOM Events sub-group, part of the Web Applications Working Group, is to complete the
UI Events specification according to market needs, to drive its adoption and implementation, to provide
a comprehensive test suite (for implementability at least, and hopefully for interoperability, too),
and to move it along the Recommendation Track to W3C Recommendation status.

## Communication

For discussion of matters related to DOM Events, the group uses the www-dom@w3.org mailing list ([archive](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/)).

## Building

This spec was created using [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed).
If you would like to contribute edits, please make sure that your changes
build correctly.

To **build** this spec:

1. Clone this repo into a local directory.
1. Install [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed)
1. Run `python build.py` in your local directory.

To **make edits** to the spec:

1. Edit the `index.bs` file or any of the `sections\*.txt` files.
2. Build (as above). This will create a `sections\*.include` file for each
    `*.txt` file and then create the `index.html`.

When submitting pull requests, make sure you don't include any of the
`sections\*.include` files in your changelist â€” they've all been added to the
`.gitignore` file so that you don't include them accidentally. All changes
should be made in the `sections\*.txt` files and `index.bs`.

## Testing
